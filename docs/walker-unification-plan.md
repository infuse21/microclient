# Walker Unification Plan

_Created: 2026-08-03. Scope: `util/walker/` runtime execution and the automation-facing
parts of `shortestpath/`. This supersedes the architectural direction in
`walker-audit.md`; `walker-p2-unification.md` remains useful historical context._

## Decision

Rewrite the walker's orchestration and state ownership incrementally. Preserve the mature
pathfinding, collision, transport-data, and interaction knowledge. The retired
`Rs2Walker.processWalk` loop must not return; new recovery belongs to NavigationEngine and its
specialised adapters.

The migration is complete only when the old orchestration is deleted. Adapters that leave
both systems permanently active are not completion.

## Live acceptance ledger

2026-09-15 Phase 6 closure: the implementation and headless gates are complete under the
2026-09-09 acceptance amendment. NavigationEngine is the sole production executor for walker
requests; unsupported initial or replacement routes fail without gameplay input or legacy
handoff. The developer executor toggle, `LEGACY_LOCKED` mode/logging, outer
`handleTransports` control loop, and its legacy-only transport bookkeeping are removed.
All 6,151 transports loaded from packaged resources classify to an engine-owned interaction
family, and the generated POH graph independently covers every configured facility plus inbound
house edges. Direct spells, all 74 direct-item rows, all 47 Clue Compass rows and all 122 Map of
Alacrity rows use staged engine commands rather than blocking legacy callbacks. Scene-adapter
search found no sleep/wait calls in the active `*Scene` command boundaries. The final repeat full
suite passes **2,278 tests, zero failures/errors and four skips**, with both Checkstyle tasks
(`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 1m 12s); the client-thread guardrail remains 900 known findings with no
regressions. The preceding full run had one known intermittent Agent Server UDS socket timeout;
all six UDS tests passed immediately in isolation before the clean repeat. Physical tests that
need unavailable items, levels, unlocks, endgame POH facilities or League worlds remain deferred
in `walker-live-testing-backlog.md` and are not claimed live-passed. Boat/Last Boat and unresolved
dynamic Respawn behavior remain in the separate future-feature backlog by user decision.

2026-09-15 Phase 7 closure: `ShortestPathPlugin` is now a UI/live-data adapter over the shared
navigation runtimes. Map and hotkey requests publish immutable engine requests; the blocking
compatibility call is isolated in `NavigationWalkRuntime` with serialized target replacement,
cancellation and shutdown. `ShortestPathScript` and its independent terminal retry loop are
deleted. Path, target marker, ETA and debug overlays read `NavigationSnapshot`/immutable
`RoutePlan` state, including copied calculation diagnostics. Live-collision conflicts publish a
blocked-edge observation to `NavigationEngineRuntime` instead of directly asking the walker to
recalculate. Login screen, connection loss and world hop invalidate the active session, while a
subsequent login still performs the deferred transport refresh. Architecture guards enforce that
shortest-path UI code does not reach into `Rs2Walker`, navigation code does not depend on plugin UI,
and the deleted script and plugin-owned lifecycle fields cannot return. Target set/replace/clear,
Ctrl+X cancellation, in-flight shutdown/restart, login/world-hop policy and empty/terminal overlay
state are covered headlessly. The full client suite passes **2,289 tests, zero failures/errors and
four skips** (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 2m 44s); both Checkstyle tasks and `git diff --check` pass.
No gameplay acceptance is claimed for this architectural phase; Phase 8 supplies the final
facade/deletion acceptance below.

2026-09-16 Phase 8 closure: `Rs2Walker` retains the established plugin-facing walking signatures,
but blocking route calls now enter a single `NavigationWalkCoordinator` lifecycle backed only by
NavigationEngine. The unreachable `processWalk` executor and its large transport/recovery branches
are deleted. `NavigationExecutionMode`, `NavigationComparison`, the ordinary-engine toggle,
ignored legacy decisions and the shadow executor corpus are removed; unsupported routes terminate
without an ownership handoff. `walkFastCanvas`, `walkCanvas`, `walkMiniMap`, `walkFastLocal` and
`walkStep` remain explicit caller-owned direct movement conveniences, not hidden route executors.
Compatibility and architecture guards pin those public signatures, the deleted executor/classes,
the single planner owner and the UI/engine dependency boundary. Focused lifecycle, route corpus,
banking and compatibility validation passes **541 tests with zero failures/errors/skips**. The
clean full client repeat passes **2,280 tests, zero failures/errors and four skips**; both Checkstyle
tasks and `git diff --check` pass. Regenerating the reviewed client-thread baseline removed 41 stale
entries and added only the two renumbered existing wall-distance lambdas, reducing it to **867**.
Rebuilt-client acceptance on world 538 issued request 2 from `(2932,10195,0)` to the known reachable
tile `(2930,10195,0)`: one `nav_cmd` was issued at `00:12:51`, followed by
`clear | rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at `00:12:52`, with no `processWalk`, `LEGACY_LOCKED`
or fallback marker. A preceding blocked exact tile terminated through bounded
`ROUTE_EXHAUSTED` replans and `navigation-engine:route-exhausted-budget-exhausted`, also without
legacy ownership. Existing deferred item/stat/League/POH physical scenarios remain in the live
testing backlog; Phase 8 does not reclassify them as live-passed.

2026-09-15 direct-item staged cutover: all 74 non-colon item rows (45 tablets, 18 scrolls,
11 other rows) now classify as ITEM_TELEPORT through `DirectItemTeleportPolicy` and
`Rs2DirectItemTeleportScene`. The engine's call to `handleTeleportItem` is removed;
SimpleTeleportPolicy no longer admits item rows. The adapter separates tab preparation,
exact inventory/equipment input, optional Wilderness confirmation and retained landing.
It dispatches copied menu identity/bounds without inventory/equipment helpers that switch
tabs or wait. Worn Teleport/Invoke/Ring actions are validated independently, and unsupported
worn actions are not guessed or replaced by an implicit unequip. Existing transport
requirements and Wilderness departure limits remain in force; no banking behavior is added.
Varrock/Watchtower tablets use their explicit destinations, and Grand seed pod uses Squash.
An existing dialogue prevents activation; accepted uses retain confirmation/landing context
after consumption, catalog disappearance or tab changes. Acknowledgement expiry replans
instead of repeating activation. First compilation, focused ownership/classification tests,
client-thread guardrails and both Checkstyle tasks pass. The final full suite passes 2,278
tests with no failures and four skips, plus both Checkstyle tasks (1m 44s). No new guardrail
exemptions were added. The old private item/spell dispatch helpers were subsequently deleted and
their absence is pinned by `TransportLoopRetirementTest`.
Action reference checks used the wiki through MCP, including Varrock/Watchtower tablets,
Revenant cave scroll, diary equipment, Royal/Grand seed pods, Ectophial, Skull sceptre,
Hallowed crystal shard and Cowbell amulet. Protocol tests use synthetic interfaces and do
not claim physical acceptance of every item, equipment slot or confirmation wording.

2026-09-15 Clue Compass staged cutover: all 47 packaged compass routes now classify as
ITEM_TELEPORT and dispatch through `Rs2ClueCompassScene`, not the blocking seasonal
callback. Inventory opening is one command; a fresh client-thread snapshot resolves one
exact direct/submenu action and copies slot, menu identifier and bounds for a single input.
The adapter does not call `Rs2Inventory.interact` (which may switch tabs and wait).
Missing/ambiguous actions, changed items, changed tabs, unpublished routes and interrupted
dispatches cannot issue the stale command. An accepted use retains voyage ownership across
tab/catalog changes until same-plane landing; missing preparation/landing acknowledgements
replan without repeating the input. The existing legacy/public helper remains for callers
outside the engine. Seven protocol regressions and a 47-row classification audit cover the
cutover; compilation, focused tests and guardrails pass. The broader transport, navigation,
banking, seasonal and pathfinder-benchmark run passes 893 tests with no failures/skips,
plus both Checkstyle tasks (41s). Its initial run caught a test fixture setting membership
instead of consumability; the corrected fixture passes without a runtime change.
Physical League-world acceptance remains explicitly deferred.

2026-09-15 historical remaining simple-item callback audit (superseded by the direct-item staged
cutover and Phase 6 closure above): the packaged item file contains 74
non-colon destination rows (45 tablets, 18 scrolls, 11 other rows). The classifier checks
SimpleTeleportPolicy before ItemTeleportPolicy, and these rows reach `handleTeleportItem`.
The 11 other rows are Fremennik sea boots (two rows), Kandarin headgear, Wilderness sword,
Western banner, Ectophial, Royal seed pod, Grand seed pod, Skull sceptre, Hallowed crystal
shard and Cowbell amulet. This is not a new-feature backlog: these are already eligible.
`handleWearableTeleports` returns false for all non-colon display names, so worn items in
this group are not covered by that callback. Inventory dispatch can additionally own
wilderness confirmation and animation waits. The 47 Clue Compass rows call the shared
inventory helper, which itself switches tabs and waits; a direct submenu label is not
proof of single-input ownership. Required cutover: separate tab preparation, exact
inventory/equipment action, any required confirmation, and retained landing observation.
Revalidate state at dispatch and preserve configuration, charge and requirement gates.

The audit found a concrete requirement defect: Ectophial listed both full `4251` and empty
`4252`. The [wiki full/empty definitions](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ectophial)
show that the empty variant has no teleport action. The resource now requires only the
full vial; a parsed-resource regression preserves reusable semantics and excludes the
empty alternative. SimpleTeleportPolicyTest, BankedTransportItemPlanningTest and
CheckstyleTest pass (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 44s); no live acceptance is claimed.
This correction did not by itself close the callback migration; the later staged adapter does.

2026-09-15 user-approved sole-executor cutover: the user explicitly authorized retiring
the developer engine toggle and failing unsupported routes instead of falling back to
legacy. Both live request entry points now select NavigationEngine, including requests
previously excluded by the blanket Stronghold-region override. Ownership is fixed at
request construction, so waiting for the first route remains engine-owned. An unsupported
initial or replacement route fails as `unsupported-route` without gameplay input or
legacy dispatch; a later generation cannot revive a failed request. The removed config
annotation retires the UI/persisted toggle; its deprecated accessor returns true only for
source compatibility and has no production callers. Normal transport settings, banked
withdrawal enablement and the separate optional banked-staff setting remain enforced.
Compilation, navigation/lifecycle/banking/config/guardrail regressions and Checkstyle pass.
Before this cutover, the full staged-spell tree passed 2,257 tests with no failures and
four skips. The latest cutover has focused validation, not a new full-suite/live claim.
The subsequent deletion removes `handleTransports`, its current-tile/raw-segment dispatch
wrappers and call sites, post-handler landing waits, and obsolete transport attempt/landing
bookkeeping (about 1,000 lines). `TransportLoopRetirementTest` guards against restoration
of the loop, its queues or the developer UI toggle. The first full run completed 2,260
tests with one guardrail failure and four skips: deletion renumbered an unchanged existing
lambda exemption. Its identity was updated and three deleted-loop exemptions removed;
no new exempted call was introduced. The repeat full suite and both Checkstyle tasks pass
(`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 1m 16s).
This historical checkpoint is superseded by the direct-item staged cutover and Phase 6 closure
above: SIMPLE_TELEPORT no longer admits item rows, and the old item/spell/seasonal callback
executors have been deleted. Physical acceptance remains deferred in the live ledger.

2026-09-15 spell preparation cutover checkpoint: engine-owned SIMPLE_TELEPORT spell
commands now dispatch through `Rs2SpellTeleportScene`, not `handleTeleportSpell` /
`Rs2Magic.cast` / `quickCast`. The existing public helpers remain unchanged for legacy
callers. The new scene observes tab opening, hidden filter-button enablement, teleport
filter selection, filter-page closing, enchantment-submenu closing and the cast as separate
inputs. It uses a bounded client-thread widget snapshot with copied identity/bounds and
the audited spellbook/sprite identity, not `MagicAction.getWidgetId()` outside that boundary.
It preserves alternate option/identifier selection, house landing evidence, wilderness
eligibility and retained staff-preparation identity. After the cast, tab/catalog changes
cannot reopen preparation before landing; preparation has an engine-owned four-second
acknowledgement deadline. Six new ownership tests cover tab/cast separation, retained
landing, timeout, interrupted/stale dispatch, hidden filters and changed spellbook.
Compilation, 393 focused navigation/banking/transport/guardrail tests and both Checkstyle
tasks pass; no guardrail exemptions were added. Physical acceptance is still deferred:
the running client was not restarted or disturbed. This supersedes the unimplemented
spell-adapter status below, not the remaining legacy transport-loop deletion gate.

2026-09-15 spell preparation audit: the remaining call chain is broader than a fixed
sleep. `handleTeleportSpell` calls `Rs2Magic.cast`, whose `canCast(MagicAction)` may
configure seven spell filters, switch tabs, close an enchantment submenu and click
Continue. The home-spell `quickCast` alternative calls `quickCanCast`, which also
switches tabs and waits. Neither is a single-input engine adapter. `MagicAction.getWidgetId`
and `getActions` are live widget searches, not immutable metadata accessors, so they
must not escape a client-thread snapshot or be treated as fixed widget constants.
The new `SimpleTeleportPolicyTest` audit checks every eligible packaged spell resolves
exactly one MagicAction name and a unique sprite within its spellbook; this test passes.
The implementation must retain alternate destination option/identifier contracts,
observe tab/filter/submenu preparation separately, copy the selected widget identity
and bounds in one client-thread callback, dispatch one input, and retain casting/landing
ownership through scene changes. This is evidence for the pending migration, not a
declaration that spell preparation is now migrated; no runtime spell code changed here.

2026-09-15 Map of Alacrity ownership follow-up: all 122 packaged rows now use the
existing ITEM_TELEPORT engine lifecycle. Inventory opening, Read, region selection,
destination selection and landing are separately observed commands; the engine owns
stage deadlines and cancellation. Empty/ambiguous menus cannot authorize guessed input,
displayed hotkeys support offscreen entries, and observed locks invalidate availability.
The blocking public helper remains only for legacy callers, not the engine dispatch path.
Eight ownership regressions pass, including loading, lock, timeout, cancellation, landing
and exact-action rejection. The metadata audit now covers 339 item-policy rows, including
the 122 Map rows. Item 33233's Read action and non-equipable status were checked against
https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Map_of_alacrity_(item); its fixture records option labels,
not fabricated cache indices. Compilation and both Checkstyle tasks pass. The full suite
ran 2,250 tests with one failure and four skips: UdsHttpServerTest.unknownPathReturns404
timed out reading its socket after 15 seconds; all six tests in that class passed on an
isolated rerun. Do not describe this full-suite checkpoint as wholly green. No client
restart or physical League acceptance was performed. This supersedes the Map ownership
gap below; spell preparation and legacy transport-loop retirement remain closure work.

2026-09-15 ownership audit follow-up: a failing headless regression proved the generated
house spell acknowledged matching template coordinates without confirming the house scene.
`SimpleTeleportRouteScanner` now delegates landing observation to its scene boundary;
`Rs2SimpleTeleportScene` requires the existing house-instance/exit-portal evidence for the
configured interior anchor, matching the item-teleport contract. Ordinary destinations retain
their three-tile, same-plane tolerance. The regression now passes, including absent house
scene, wrong plane, source position and successful house entry observations. Compilation,
759 transport/navigation/guardrail tests and both Checkstyle tasks pass; guardrails remain
903 known client-thread findings and zero queryable findings, with no regressions. Physical
house-spell acceptance remains deferred; the running client was not restarted or disturbed.

The call-chain audit also found an active Phase 6 ownership gap, not merely dead legacy code:
`NAVIGATION_WALKER_ACTIONS.interact` -> `handleSeasonalTransport` ->
`Rs2MapOfAlacrityTransport.tryUse` opens the map, waits, selects a region, waits again and
selects the destination inside one engine command. All 122 rows classifying as supported
does not prove those stages are engine-owned. Replace this with retained, nonblocking
open/region/destination/landing observations and add stage, loading, lock, timeout and
cancellation regressions before retiring the transport loop. Also audit the remaining
simple-teleport helper calls: `Rs2Magic.cast` currently opens the magic tab and sleeps before
casting. Preserve public legacy helpers until their callers are deliberately cut over;
do not move the same blocking orchestration into a renamed adapter.

2026-09-15 scope decision and closure audit: the user explicitly moved Boat/Last Boat
and remaining dynamic Respawn support to the separate
[future transport feature backlog](walker-future-transport-features.md). They were not
legacy-supported features; their earlier Phase 6 blocker labels are superseded.
Packaged transport classification and generated POH entry coverage pass, with the latest
full suite at 2,240 tests, zero failures/errors and four skips. This is not yet a Phase 6
completion declaration: its explicit deletion gate still fails. `Rs2Walker.handleTransports`
retains nested dispatch, approach clicks and waits, and `tryProcessNavigationEngine` can
still return to legacy execution when disabled or not engine-owned. The remaining closure
work is to retire that transport control loop and its legacy-only bookkeeping, preserving
family interactions and testing unsupported-route and disabled-engine behavior explicitly.
Do not equate complete row classification with removal of duplicate orchestration.
Phase 7 UI adaptation and Phase 8 `processWalk` removal remain separate work.

2026-09-15 generated POH entry closure: the generator-level audit now includes every configured
facility plus world-to-house routes, not just packaged TSV rows. It exposed and now covers
Construction cape `Tele to POH` and house tablet `Inside`. Cape/default house-spell destinations
are mutually exclusive varbit-gated interior/exterior edges; the outside leg chains to the
existing engine-owned physical portal. All nine configured house locations, both preference
values, unknown preference exclusion, changed-setting rejection and tablet consumption are
covered headlessly. Compilation, focused tests, guardrails and checkstyle pass. The inside/outside
flag mapping was verified live with the user's permission; the original preference and running
script state were restored. Physical cape/spell/tablet acceptance remains in the backlog, not
claimed by this metadata check. This does not close unresolved dynamic Boat/Respawn coverage.
Full unit-suite checkpoint after this batch: 2,240 tests, zero failures/errors, four skips;
completed in 2m13s. Thread-safety guardrail remains 903 known findings with no regressions.

[walker-live-testing-backlog.md](walker-live-testing-backlog.md) consolidates earlier and current
headless batches, outstanding branches of representative live passes, and contracts still needing
implementation. As of 2026-09-06 the user requests headless-first progress; deferred physical tests
remain open rather than blocking each batch or being silently marked complete.

Acceptance amendment (user instruction, 2026-09-09): Phase 6 may close on implementation and
headless verification while unavailable-item/high-stat/endgame live tests remain deferred in
the live ledger. They are not live-passed and no account progression is required to close this
phase. This supersedes earlier physical-gate closure wording. Remaining implementation defects,
ownership gaps and unsupported-route decisions still require resolution before Phase 7.

## Active-graph classification closure and resolver hardening - 2026-09-09

Respawn nexus partial cutover (2026-09-15): six explicit named respawn flags now select
their own destinations through the engine-owned nexus lifecycle. Ambiguous Lumbridge/Prifddinas
state remains unavailable pending reliable detection or an explicit configuration decision.
Pre-dispatch landing revalidation and flag-based transport-cache invalidation are included;
unknown/null destinations are not published. Boat and ambiguous Respawn remain open work.

Combined checkpoint after jewellery fixes (2026-09-15): full unit suite and both
Checkstyles passed in 2m13s: **2,232 tests, zero failures/errors, four skips**.
This includes Dondakan quest filtering and Farming Guild landing/revalidation. It does
not close the dynamic Respawn/Boat implementation gaps. Read-only Boat research now
identifies SailingDock table 194 (Port Sarim ID 0, Pandemonium ID 1), but its exposed
fields do not establish player teleport landing coordinates; details are in the ledger.

Farming Guild box follow-up (2026-09-15): level-dependent inside/outside landing now uses
the existing skills-necklace endpoints instead of the shared equipment enum's approximate
outside tile. Published transport endpoints remain snapshots; a changed threshold marks the
pending interaction unavailable before dispatch. Physical level/boost checks remain deferred.
Dynamic nexus Respawn and Boat contracts are still implementation gaps.

Jewellery requirement audit (2026-09-15): Dondakan's generated POH route now requires
Between a Rock completion, matching the existing item transport. A constructor regression
first reproduced the absent gate. This closes that requirement omission, not the remaining
Farming Guild landing or dynamic nexus contracts; physical box verification remains deferred.

Combined checkpoint (2026-09-15): full `:client:runUnitTests` plus both Checkstyles passed
in 2m52s, **2,231 tests, zero failures/errors, four skips**. This includes the bank object
null-location fix, progress-based recovery budgets, inbound DIQ and the expanded nexus
mapping/alternatives. Client-thread guardrail remains 903 with no new regressions.
Dynamic Respawn and Boat/Last Boat contracts remain unresolved implementation work;
green full-suite results do not close those gaps or Phase 6.

Nexus alternatives (2026-09-15): Seers' Village and Yanille now have explicit menu/landing
contracts gated by the installed base destination and corresponding hard diary. Original
Camelot/Watchtower routes remain available. Respawn and Boat/Last Boat still need dynamic
landing contracts; advanced-facility physical checks remain deferred, not passed.

Nexus fixed-destination expansion (2026-09-15): saved values 32-39 now publish Trollheim,
Paddewwa, Lassar, Dareeyak, Ourania, Barbarian Outpost, Port Khazard and Ice Plateau.
Coordinates reuse the corresponding chamber destination contracts. Dareeyak and Ice Plateau
join the destination-scoped Wilderness confirmation stage. Respawn (40), Boat (41),
alternative destinations and the wider menu/landing audit remain open; they are not waived.

Nexus saved-value correction (2026-09-15): live cache enum 1377/struct parameter 660
proved several existing Java enum ordinals selected the wrong destinations. Corrected
saved-slot decoding and added an independent 31-value name fixture. The same read-only
capture established the missing 32-41 mappings and alternative 151/154/156/191 keys;
their landing/menu contracts remain implementation work, recorded in the live backlog.

POH fairy-ring follow-up (2026-09-15): inbound DIQ now uses the fairy-ring engine protocol
only for the configured house destination, complementing outbound house-ring ownership.
Landing is resolved beside the actual usable ring in the player's house world view, not beside
the synthetic exit anchor. Pending landing/restoration does not require the transport to remain
in the equipment-filtered graph. Physical DIQ acceptance remains deferred; this does not close
the remaining nexus destination/menu audit or Phase 6.

Nexus initial-cutover checkpoint (2026-09-12): the current tree passes **2,223 unit tests,
zero failures/errors, four skips**, and both Checkstyles in 2m50s. The 32 existing nexus
enum destinations now use the retained portal menu/hotkey/confirmation lifecycle, and saved
slot discovery includes slots 36-45. This supersedes the blanket nexus-ownership absence
below, not the remaining facility audit: ten newer destination mappings, dynamic destinations,
menu/variant edge cases, jewellery destination contracts and house ring/tree execution remain
open. No physical nexus acceptance or Phase 6 closure is claimed.

Full-suite checkpoint (2026-09-12): the accumulated cancellation-lock, Draynor tunnel and
jewellery-box changes pass **2,220 unit tests, zero failures/errors, four skips**, with both
Checkstyles, in 2m29s. Client-thread/queryable guardrails remain **903/0**, without regressions
or new exemptions. This verifies the current headless tree, not all generated POH protocols:
nexus and house fairy-ring/spirit-tree ownership remain open, as does the jewellery destination
eligibility/menu-contract audit recorded in the live-testing ledger. Phase 6 is not closed.

Wintertodt multi-tile-door follow-up (2026-09-10): the rebuilt client now enters the live
`Enter;Doors of Dinh;29322` boundary successfully. The catalogue identity is corrected to the live
plural name, and exact-ID catalogue lookup now measures the normal approach radius from a game
object's occupied footprint rather than only its south-west cache anchor. This retains the existing
fast anchor lookup and transformed-object fallback without globally widening scene search. The
user observed the successful entry; Agent Server state then confirmed the logged-in character
inside at `(1638,3995,0)`, and the subsequent NavigationEngine leg from `(1634,3978,0)` reached
`(1638,3996,0)` with `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived`. All 16 Wintertodt approaches pass the
shared-object regression, all 454 walker transport tests pass, and the 903/0 client-thread/queryable
guardrails plus both Checkstyles remain green. This live acceptance covers the Doors of Dinh only;
other large multi-tile catalogue objects remain headless-covered or deferred until physically
tested.

Mounted-menu follow-up (2026-09-10): all three mounted Digsite pendant and all four
mounted Xeric's talisman destinations now use the retained TELEPORTATION_PORTAL lifecycle.
The scene publishes explicit object-menu and exact-destination stages, accepts a transformed
object's direct destination action, resolves the decorative object in the current house/world
view and approaches its actual room tile. Missing or struck-through menu destinations publish
UNAVAILABLE; source disappearance is not arrival and the selected remote landing remains the
completion condition. The fail-first ownership test saw object ID 0/TRANSPORT before the
cutover. Compilation, all mounted/chamber ownership and scene tests, both client-thread
guardrails, the pathfinder benchmark and both Checkstyles pass; the guardrail baselines remain
903/0. Physical use remains deferred, and nexus, jewellery, house ring/tree integration and
the POH graph-generator correction remain open.

POH network-generator follow-up (2026-09-10): `createTransportsToPoh` no longer stops at
the first external origin. Permutation expansion now retains its source and destination
endpoint components, allowing the house generator to publish exactly one inbound edge from
every external origin and one outbound edge to every external destination without copying an
unrelated endpoint's item/skill/quest/var requirement. A fail-first four-endpoint test lacked
the second inbound edge and then pins all four directed house connections, exact requirement
isolation and two non-duplicated outbound edges. Focused POH, transport-cost and route tests
pass. House fairy-ring and spirit-tree execution ownership remains open; this correction proves
their graph topology and requirement provenance only.

Post-mounted/generator full-suite checkpoint: **2,216 tests, zero failures/errors and four
skips** passed with both Checkstyle tasks in 1m52s. The expected PluginManager fixture errors
remain test-local noise; the suite completed successfully. No live client was available and no
physical POH acceptance is claimed.

Mounted-direct follow-up adds four glory destinations and the mythical cape to the same
house-only TELEPORTATION_PORTAL lifecycle, bringing the typed direct POH slice to 45
destinations. Decorative-object IDs/actions are cache-verified and re-resolved in the current
world view; engine approach uses the room object, not the house anchor. Mounted digsite and
Xeric's retain their unsupported classification pending staged menu ownership. Compilation,
focused engine/scene/portal/ownership/guardrail/benchmark checks and both Checkstyles pass
(1m30s); no guardrail exemptions or live-pass claims were added.

POH chamber cutover: all 40 typed chamber enum destinations now use the existing
TELEPORTATION_PORTAL classifier/scanner/dispatch lifecycle. The cache-backed adapter resolves
only inside a house, within the player's world view, using the base or active composition ID
and the named destination action. Stable canonical IDs identify the pending command across
decorative variants; actual template object tiles determine approach readiness. Tests cover
all enum destinations and object-ID variants, transformed identity, Grand Exchange with
Varrock preferred, wrong world/object/action, distant approach and source unloading until
the selected landing. Other POH facility types and untyped lookalikes remain legacy-classified.
Physical tests remain deferred under the amended acceptance scope, not live-passed.

Chamber validation checkpoint: full suite passed with 2,212 tests, zero failures/errors and
four skips; compilation and both Checkstyles passed (4m6s). A preceding run found one
guardrail finding from a nested stream predicate reading ObjectComposition.getId; the ID
is now captured directly in the client-thread snapshot, retaining the 903-entry baseline.
The subsequent engine approach correction targets the resolved chamber object rather than
the synthetic house anchor and has a dedicated engine execution regression; its focused
validation is separate from this full-suite checkpoint.
That final focused run passed all 90 engine/portal/chamber/guardrail/benchmark tests with
zero failures/errors/skips, compilation and both Checkstyles (1m24s). No exemptions were added.

Closure-audit qualification: the zero-legacy assertion in RemainingTransportClassificationTest
covers `Transport.loadAllFromResources()`, not every runtime-generated edge. It now requires
all resource transport types to be present, so silently missing families cannot yield a false
green result. POH facilities are added separately by `PohPanel.getAvailableTransports()`:
configured chamber/nexus/jewellery/mounted destinations become `PohTransport` rows, and house
rings/trees are connected through generated maps. FairyRingPolicy and SpiritTreePolicy still
exclude the configured house anchor and their house destinations. Advanced POH is therefore
an implementation/ownership audit priority, not merely an unavailable-live-test entry.
Historical disabled-row research remains separate; its 64 no-local-match rows are not the
denominator for current runtime migration completeness. Do not infer Phase 6 closure from
the resource-only classifier result.

Post-Ice-Troll full-suite checkpoint: compilation, all 2,208 unit tests (zero failures/errors,
four skips) and both Checkstyle tasks pass in 3m32s. The first run exposed three stale
FremennikBridgeTransportTest assumptions after the underground additions: surface-only count,
an overbroad agility-ID range and hard-coded plane-0 geometry. Assertions now cover all 15
crossings, preserve the mine-only level-40 requirement, and reject incomplete/wrong-plane
landings in each direction. No runtime code or guardrail exemption changed for this correction;
the guardrail reports 903 known violations and no regressions. This supersedes the earlier
2,204-test checkpoint below, without claiming physical acceptance or Phase 6 completion.

Ice Troll bridge follow-up restores all five underground directions through exact quest-state
passage ownership. Only the southbound boss-entry bridge carries the completed ten-troll
counter requirement (3312=0); the four other directions do not inherit that entrance gate.
Shared tests now cover 13 directed contracts/22 state variants, including stale-state rejection
when zero is the valid counter value. Selected scene/policy, route, source-audit and benchmark
tests, compilation and both Checkstyles pass (1m58s). Physical cutscene/retreat/post-quest
behaviour stays explicitly deferred in the ledger rather than being claimed live-complete.

Eastern Ice Troll cave follow-up adds three approaches with two exact quest-state variants
each (3311=300/310), reusing QuestStatePassagePolicy and its existing dispatcher. Placement
matches anchor (2401,3889,0); old completed-quest exclusions now distinguish the legitimate
quest-time entry from the unchanged western post-quest entrance. Stage 320/corpse return and
the five underground bridge directions are not declared implemented. The selected route,
quest-scene/policy, source-audit and benchmark tests pass with compilation and both Checkstyle
tasks (2m12s). Deferred physical checks follow the amended acceptance scope.

Tears-cave follow-up restores six member-only Enter approaches under catalog ownership, using
exact template anchors rather than the generic radius that misses the inward object's footprint.
No quest, item or automatic protective-loadout requirement is added. The scanner acknowledges
only the selected remote landing; source durations/comments are preserved. A fail-first scene
test reported zero loaded routes. After implementation, all six scene and policy cases passed;
the broader inventory assertion was updated from 34 to 40 and explicitly pins all six new
classifications. Compilation, 79 selected tests (route/source/scene/audit/benchmark) and both
Checkstyle tasks pass (1m9s). Loader count is 6,149 origins. Physical timing/landing remains
deferred under the user's revised acceptance scope; the full-suite checkpoint below predates
the museum and Tears batches.

Museum follow-up restores four upstairs Leave exits after offline placement proved effective
plane-0 anchors beside the historical approaches. Exact policy and object-ID checks exclude the
downstairs prop, and the scanner requires the chosen surface landing. A fail-first source test
reported zero rather than four rows; a subsequent scene test exposed name-fallback acceptance of
the wrong ID, now rejected. The 78-test route/scene/source/audit/benchmark selection, compilation
and both Checkstyle tasks pass (1m42s). Loader count is 6,143 origins. Physical landings remain
pending; the full-suite checkpoint below predates this museum batch.

Latest full-suite checkpoint after restoring Karuulm protection and fixing classifier precedence:
**2,204 tests, zero failures/errors, four skips**, BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4m15s. Compilation and
both Checkstyle tasks passed; client-thread/queryable guardrails remained 903/0 with no regressions.
This supersedes the failed checkpoints below, including the intermittent UDS timeout, but does
not prove that timeout cannot recur or close any physical-live gate. The museum comment/test-name
correction was made while this run executed and is validated separately.

Withdrawal audit: walker/shortestpath has one direct bank-withdrawal call, behind
`withdrawBankedTransportRequirement`; the coordinator delegates to it. Both each withdrawal
and the banked-walk entry point require `walkWithBankedTransports()`, including forced bank
route comparisons. No alternate inventory-setup or rune-pouch refill call was found in this scope.

User scope clarification: retain Karuulm protection preparation. Banked boots, like Dramen/Lunar
staffs for fairy-ring travel, may only be withdrawn while Walk with banked transports is enabled.
Already-carried required equipment remains usable without banking; optional elemental spell
staff withdrawals remain separately opt-in. The briefly applied Karuulm removal was restored
before validation and did not become the intended implementation.

Full-suite follow-up exposed stale Steps/Rocks inventory assertions and, after splitting the
Karuulm variants into a dedicated ownership assertion, a real classifier-precedence gap: four
one-tile free/diary northern rock variants selected ADJACENT_TRANSPORT before the dedicated
catalog handler. Karuulm object identities now reject generic adjacent ownership, so all 54
variants reach the catalog dispatcher and its requirement rechecks. The focused route,
Karuulm scene/policy, adjacent-policy and benchmark run passes with compilation and both
Checkstyle tasks (37 seconds). This is headless evidence, not a physical acceptance trace.

The latest full run before that fix had 2,203 tests, two failures and four skips: the new
ownership assertion and a 15-second socket-read timeout in UdsHttpServerTest.malformedRequestYields400.
The preceding 2,202-test run failed only the two outdated inventory assertions. The full suite
must be rerun after the ownership fix; no green full-suite claim is made from the focused pass.

Karuulm follow-up now owns safe elevator entry and protected onward travel across 24 directed
contracts (54 equipment/diary/free variants). Escape directions remain equipment-free. The
47-test focused validation, benchmark, unchanged guardrails and both Checkstyle tasks pass;
physical acceptance remains open in the live ledger. Loader count is 6,139 origins. The earlier
full-suite timeout checkpoint below predates this batch and is not superseded by a focused run.

Canifis tavern follow-up restores the two post-Myreque object-5055 entry approaches under
CatalogTransition ownership, rechecking the quest at dispatch and acknowledging only the exact
underground landing. Loader count is now 6,129 origins. The earlier quest-stage unlock and
physical acceptance remain open; historical counts below are not a current completion percentage.

Latest full-suite run after Canifis and the staff option: 2,197 tests, one failure, four skips.
The failure was a 15-second socket-read timeout in `UdsHttpServerTest.authTokenAccepted`; its
six-test class passed immediately in isolation without a source change. All other tests passed,
and guardrails remained 903/0 with no regressions. Full-suite stability is not proved by that
isolated rerun; the latest full run is not green.

Earlier passing full-suite checkpoint, including the eastern stones, entrance pipe, rune reservations,
banked-staff integration and withdrawal-config guard: **2,193 tests, zero failures/errors, four
skips**. XML reports were inspected and Gradle confirmed `runUnitTests`, compilation and both
Checkstyle tasks successful/up-to-date on 2026-09-09. This supersedes the earlier 2,159-test
checkpoint, but does not close any physical-live or unfinished implementation gate.

Banking follow-up: a fail-first production-collector regression reproduced two lava runes
planned for Varrock plus Watchtower instead of three. Ordered per-cast physical-rune reservations
now preserve those consumption boundaries across carried, pouch and bank stock, leaving equipped
infinite supplies non-consuming. The collector requests unexpanded rune counts and preserves the
coordinator's inventory-target contract. Mixed overlapping combination types and actual server
consumption order remain unproved; see the live ledger's multi-cast entry. Banked staff
equipment/restoration now has a headlessly tested selection, preparation and restoration path;
whole-journey bank-only-staff acceptance and the remaining edge cases in the live ledger stay open.
Compilation, all 56 banking tests and both Checkstyle tasks passed (zero failures/errors/skips,
39s final combined run); no runtime restart or physical acceptance is claimed.

Bulk cross-resource duplicate audit: of 155 commented numeric traversal rows, 17 match an
active numeric origin/destination/action/name/object-ID contract after normalizing action/name
spacing and hyphens. This is an inventory check, not proof of equivalent requirements or live
behaviour. Matches comprise two Slug passages, four eastern Brimhaven stones, two entrance
pipes, two Enakhra rubble rows, one Zogre barricade, two Wilderness Slayer Cave crevice
comments and four Fremennik strange-floor rows. Keep historical comments disabled; enabling
their ordinary variants could bypass the active agility or quest requirements.

Wiki ID checks confirm that the active strange floor `16544` correctly requires 43 Agility
([Fremennik floor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Strange_floor_(Fremennik_Slayer_Dungeon)))
and crevice `53259` correctly requires 77
([Wilderness crevice](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crevice_(Wilderness_Slayer_Cave))).
The entrance pipe `21728` had an asymmetric-requirement defect: both active
directions required 22, but only travel toward the moss giants requires 22; the reverse is free
([entrance pipe](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pipe_(Brimhaven_Dungeon_entrance))).
The northbound `(2655,9566,0)->(2655,9573,0)` row now has no skill requirement; southbound
retains 22. `BrimhavenEntrancePipeTest` first reproduced the incorrect requirement, and a
transport-free collision flood connects the south endpoint to the Wiki moss-giant area but
not the north endpoint. The flood bounds must include the connecting corridor east of x2670;
the Wiki monster marker is a map centre, not a guaranteed walkable tile. Both rows retain
agility classification and CatalogTransition ownership. Do not confuse this with the separate
object `21727` pipe, whose inward requirement is 34. Physical crossing remains unproved,
and the bookkeeping count below is deliberately not reduced again without reconciling the
original inventory.

Entrance-pipe validation: compilation, 19 Brimhaven/benchmark tests and both Checkstyle tasks
passed in 1m 25s with zero failures/errors/skips. The change is resource-only in production;
the existing NavigationEngine interaction remains unchanged. Live acceptance stays deferred.

Eastern Brimhaven stones follow-up: the four “disabled” ordinary rows already had active agility
counterparts. Their inward/outward skill requirement was wrong. The collision map proves which
two endpoints share the island, so the canonical rows now require 56 only inward, with exact
source-stone resolution, current-level revalidation and landing acknowledgement. Compilation,
36 focused tests, benchmark, unchanged guardrail and both Checkstyle tasks passed in 1m 48s.
Do not count this as four new routes: loaded origins stay at the prior count, and the
remaining 74 unresolved source contracts are not yet a deduplicated runtime-gap inventory.

Full-suite checkpoint after the quest-state batch: the first run completed 2,143 tests in
3m 18s with two failures and four skips.

**Follow-up checkpoint passed:** after correcting those expectations and adding a test-only
15-second deadline to the UDS smoke tests, all 2,143 tests completed with zero failures/errors
and four skips in 3m 27s; both Checkstyle tasks passed. All six UDS tests also passed in isolation.
The timeout converts a future unbounded socket read into a failing test; it does not prove the
intermittent missing-response cause was fixed. No production Agent Server code changed.
This supersedes the incomplete full-rerun status below, but not any open live acceptance gates.

Initial checkpoint detail:
Both failures were stale Weiss source tests still
requiring the migrated rope/ledge rows to be disabled. They now pin all four exact directed
rows, ascent skills and installed-rope requirements, including rejection after gate mutation.
The full rerun did not finish: a thread dump proved the test worker blocked in
`UdsHttpServerTest.unknownPathReturns404 -> roundTrip:136 -> SocketChannel.read`, while the UDS
accept thread waited for another connection. Only that verified Gradle test worker was stopped;
the live client was untouched. A subsequent focused run passed all 50 Weiss/northern/engine
checks and both Checkstyle tasks in 27s. **A successful full-suite rerun remains outstanding**;
do not report this checkpoint as globally green or treat the UDS stall as a walker regression.

Quest-state passage follow-up: Zogre barricade (496=1), opened Slug wall (2618=1), static reverse
passage and both Enakhra rubble directions (1560 exactly 50/60/65/70) now share an exact catalog
resolver. Eleven variants represent five directed contracts; no puzzle/setup actions are added.
The copied cache confirms anchors and absent intermediate quest transforms. Compilation, 25 focused
tests, benchmark, unchanged guardrail and both Checkstyle tasks passed in 1m 42s. Current totals
are 6,127 loaded origins / 78 genuine disabled traversals;
rebuilt-client crossings and state-change rejection remain open in the live ledger.

Quest-trapdoor follow-up: Basement of Doom now has an exact staged catalog entry,
12267/Open -> 12268/Go-down -> underground landing, with the completed Shadow of the Storm
requirement retained and rechecked. Opening is not crossing. Compilation, 110 focused tests,
benchmark, unchanged guardrail and both Checkstyle tasks passed in 1m 45s. Current totals:
6,122 loaded origins / 83 genuine disabled traversals. Live
closed/open entry and cancellation remain open. Grand Tree/Canifis entry protocols are not
inferred from this pair and remain disabled pending their own evidence.

Molch barrier follow-up: 20 directed rows now share exact catalog ownership and colour-dependent
damage checks. Four disabled entries had a one-digit object-ID typo (34542 lava scenery instead
of Molch barrier 34642); the remaining 16 previously used the adjacent handler without those
checks. Copied-cache transforms/anchors support five independently coloured barriers, not a
Karuulm heat entrance. Compilation, 89 focused tests, benchmark, unchanged guardrail and both
Checkstyle tasks passed in 1m 10s; the production loader reports 6,121 origins, with 84 genuine
disabled traversals remaining after resolving the four typo rows. Keep rebuilt-client colour changes, repeated
crossing damage, both lanes/directions and counter decay open in the live ledger; this is not
acceptance of the separate Karuulm stairs/elevator contract.

Resource Area follow-up audit and cutover: the five gate-26760 rows already put the tiered fares
on the correct inward edge, `(3184,3945,0) -> (3184,3944,0)`; do not reverse them. Offline
cache region 12605 places the gate at `(3184,3944,0)` with `Open`/`Peek`, and the area's gold
rocks, anvil and furnace lie south of it. The bundled Wilderness diary helpers independently
identify those interior resource coordinates. The [gate wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Gate_(Resource_Area))
and [area wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Resource_Area) confirm membership and the
7,500/6,000/3,750/free tiers. All five retained rows now explicitly carry the members flag;
their source regression pins direction, fare, diary predicates, membership and duration.
The old reverse-fare comment was incorrect. The user's screenshot and manual crossing now establish
`Open -> Pay 7500 coins to enter? -> Yes -> inward crossing`. All five rows are restored with
catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership, an exact fare-title and unique Yes/No menu check, current
coin/diary checks, and exact directed landing. Confirmation disappearance cannot reopen the gate;
ordinary adjacent-door ownership is excluded, and a blocked edge prevents coin-free ground routing.
Paid variants use the existing shared bank-planning predicate; the free exit and elite entry do not
request coins. The 6,000/3,750 prompt forms are headless expectations based on the diary fares,
not separately observed interfaces. Rebuilt-engine crossing, withdrawal/fare deduction and
discounted/elite/free-exit acceptance remain open; the user's manual input is not engine acceptance.

Resource Area verification follow-up: all eight medium/hard/elite flag combinations select exactly
one inward fare plus the unconditional free exit, and production route publication classifies all
five variants as `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The actual scene adapter is exercised with synthetic widgets:
only its pending Open exposes the exact 7,500-coin confirmation, successful dispatch issues one Yes,
and a changed price or lost coin shortfall rejects further input. These eight Resource Area tests,
the route-publication suite and test Checkstyle pass. This extends the prior 728-test green batch;
it does not replace rebuilt-client acceptance. No client restart or gameplay input was issued.

Full-suite follow-up: `:client:runUnitTests :client:checkstyleMain :client:checkstyleTest`
passed in 1m 10s with 2,122 tests, zero failures/errors and four skipped. This run includes the
Resource Area changes; the running client was left untouched and physical acceptance remains open.

Southern Brimhaven backdoor research (2026-09-09): the earlier statement that no client unlock
variable is known is superseded. `VarbitID.KARAM_DUNGEON_BACKDOOR` and the Wiki MCP data both
identify varbit `5629`. An offline copy of the game cache resolves base object `66` through
`[30199, 30200, 30200, 30200, -1]`: value zero is an actionless `Hole` (30199), values 1-3 are
`Rope` (30200) with `Climb`, and the fallback has no object. Interior object `30201` is a
non-transforming `Crevice` with `Use`, so its presence alone cannot prove access. The
[Banisoch wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Banisoch) explicitly requires the one-time
5,000-trading-stick payment for both entering and exiting. The four inward approaches and one
outward row are now restored with members-only, bounded `5629>0;5629<4` requirements. Exact
catalogue ownership rejects ungated/foreign rows; one client-thread scene snapshot rechecks the
unlock and resolves only base rope 66 or transformed rope 30200 with the correct name/action,
or exact exit crevice 30201. Dispatch repeats that snapshot, and the common scanner requires the
exact directed landing. No purchase or recurring fare is inferred. Focused scene/source/route
publication tests, compilation, Checkstyle and the client-thread guardrail pass; physical crossing
and the first-time purchase protocol remain unaccepted. Probe:
`%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/leaf-pit-cache-20260909/BrimhavenBackdoorCache.java`.

Southern Brimhaven validation: after correcting a missing test type qualification, compilation,
the focused policy/scene/publication checks, both Checkstyle tasks and the full unit suite pass.
The final run completed in 1m 55s: 2,125 tests, zero failures/errors and four skipped, including
the production classification boundary and pathfinder benchmark. No guardrail exemptions were
added, no client restart/gameplay input was issued, and no commit was made.

Brimhaven metal-dragon passage correction (2026-09-09): the previous task-gate deferral conflated
combat permission with movement. [Hieve](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hieve) and his
[transcript](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Transcript:Hieve) describe checks when attacking;
the original [Diverse Dungeons update](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Diverse_Dungeons)
states that the area's monsters are only killable on task. The
[crevice page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crevice_(Brimhaven_Dungeon)) identifies the two
passage objects separately from the paid southern exit. Offline cache object 30198 is a static
`Crevice` with `Enter`, anchored at `(2685,9436,0)` and `(2696,9436,0)`. Both catalogue directions,
`(2684,9436,0) <-> (2697,9436,0)`, now use exact members-only catalogue ownership with no invented
task requirement. The scene requires object 30198, and only exact directed landing clears it.
This supports traversal, not combat permission; physical crossing without a task remains live-pending.
Compilation, 86 focused Brimhaven/route-classification/benchmark/guardrail tests and both Checkstyle
tasks passed in 1m 16s with no failures or skips. The guardrail remains at 903 with no new exemptions.
This is a focused run after the earlier 2,125-test full-suite pass, not a new full-suite claim.

Main Brimhaven entrance batch (2026-09-09): the 14 disabled entrance aliases are replaced by
21 canonical base-20877 variants across seven approaches. Each approach has disjoint 875-coin,
already-paid single-visit (`5628=1;8122=0`) and permanent (`8122=1`) requirements. The paid variant
requires both flags zero and participates in shared bank planning. Door-data varbit 8123 includes
the unrelated southern-door bits; only bits 0 and 3 indicate main-entry access. The scene resolves
only the exact cache anchor `(2743,3153,0)` and the matching Pay/Enter transform, scopes both
payment menus to a pending Pay, never buys permanent access, and continues only the owned
Saniboch payment receipt. Confirmation cannot cause another payment, even before access refreshes.
Only `(2713,9564,0)` clears the pending leg. The conflicting object-20878 exit rows remain disabled.
Physical payment, bank withdrawal, receipt/entry timing and permanent-access entry remain live-pending.
Validation: production classification and the benchmark passed in the initial batch. After fixing
the explicit NPC-widget wrapper and scene-test fixture, compilation, 14 focused Brimhaven/guardrail
tests and both Checkstyle tasks passed in 59s; the guardrail baseline remains unchanged at 903.

Northern shortcut batch (2026-09-09): all ten Weiss cliff directions and four Ungael side passages
are headless-migrated together. Ungael uses the defeated-quest-Vorkath unlock `6108>29`, not a
combat-crater entrance. Weiss's installed rope uses `6528>44`; first-time installation remains
quest-helper work. Ascents require 68 Agility and current HP above 15, descents do not, and all
Weiss rows respect the agility toggle. Exact source readiness and object anchors prevent ranged
skips; exact earlier-stage falls force a replan even when the zig-zag geometry fools the generic
direction projection. Exact destination alone clears the crossing. Compilation, 142 focused
tests, the unchanged 903-entry guardrail and both Checkstyle tasks passed in 1m 35s. Benchmark
total best-route times were 1,343ms. All physical crossings and failure observations remain open
in the live ledger; no gameplay input, client restart or commit was performed.

The current production resource set loads **6,117 transport origins** and has no active route edge left
classified as the generic legacy `TRANSPORT` kind. This closes the active-graph classification
boundary only: after restoring the four leaf jumps, five Resource Area rows, five southern Brimhaven rows
and two metal-dragon passage rows, replacing 14 main-entrance aliases and restoring 14 northern
shortcuts, **88 genuine disabled traversals** remain whose quest,
equipment, safety, payment, failure or staged-interaction contracts remain implementation work.
Phase 6 therefore remains open, and Phase 7 deletion has not started.

The final active item batch moves the two Camulet destinations and the Hunter/Max cape Feldip and
Black-chinchompa destinations into exact item-teleport ownership, including charges, the shared
Hunter daily counter, scoped Wilderness confirmation, and worn-item restoration. Five God Wars
boulder approaches and two Saradomin rope descents now have exact strength/setup/installed-state
contracts; the latter expose separate consumable-rope setup and permanent-rope variants. Guarded
protocol, residual exit and hazardous-transition batches retain their exact requirement and landing
checks rather than broadening generic actions.

Two live regressions are now headlessly covered. A shared scene-coordinate boundary maps live
instance objects into the template coordinate space used by the route, and maps exact route probes
back into every matching live instance tile. Ordinary doors, catalog transitions, adjacent
transports and exact mineable/object probes therefore no longer disappear merely because the scene
is instanced; this includes the GOTR door-before-stairs failure. Large agility objects use a bounded
five-tile catalog lookup while preserving exact ID/name/action matching; this fixes the Draynor
underwall route that reached `(3065,3260,0)` but could not resolve object `19032` anchored at
`(3067,3257,0)`. Synthetic instance-chunk tests cover both conversion directions. These changes
require rebuilt-client physical confirmation.

Catalog candidate discovery and composition inspection now execute as one client-thread snapshot
instead of issuing a blocking client-thread call for every fallback candidate. Ctrl+X or another
client-thread timeout declines the pending interaction without converting ordinary cancellation
into a walker exception. The minimap walking hot path also uses one immutable widget-bounds
snapshot instead of synchronously loading sprite data, and timed-out client-thread futures are no
longer interrupted.

Ten previously disabled equipment transitions are restored with exact contracts: four Smoke
Dungeon Smokey-well approaches require Desert Treasure I progress and a currently valid worn face
protection item (no light-source requirement); two Troll Stronghold uphill rocks require 15 Agility
and climbing boots; four Trollweiss slopes require a waxed sled and completed Troll Romance. The
same alternatives feed route availability and bank planning, while NavigationEngine owns inventory
preparation, equipment, object dispatch and exact directed landing. All ten remain live-deferred.

Ten wrecked Ghosts Ahoy ship-rock jumps are also restored as members-only, 25-Agility catalogue
transitions. Their live scene stage waits nonblockingly at the selected rock below 5% run energy,
publishes `Jump-To` once the threshold is reached, and requires the exact opposite tile after either
a normal or damaging attempt. The route does not claim to solve Ghosts Ahoy, and the full five-jump
chain plus the low-energy wait remain live-deferred.

Eleven Ice Path gate approaches are restored with exact object, geometry and landing contracts.
The five inward rows require Desert Treasure I progress plus the post-child-sequence unlock
(`382>1`); the six outward rows remain available because they only leave the area. This slice owns
the gate crossing, not survival in the extreme-cold area beyond it, and remains live-deferred.

Eight post-Royal-Trouble stepping-stone directions are restored with one reusable plank as a
bankable item requirement. NavigationEngine stages the inventory selection and then issues `Use`
on the exact rocks object, retaining ownership until the exact opposite tile is observed. Repeated
edges plan one plank rather than consuming one per crossing. Both completed-quest ropeswing rows
are also restored with 40 Agility and permanent-installation varbit `2147=1`; first-time quest rope
installation remains outside walker ownership. Both obstacle families remain live-deferred.

Four failure-prone but source-side-safe shortcuts are restored: both Lighthouse broken-bridge
directions and both Karamja wooden-log directions. Failed attempts leave the player on the origin
side, so NavigationEngine retains the pending edge and retries until the exact destination is
observed. Six Regicide stick crossings similarly retain ownership after an 8-damage knockback, but
their live scene resolver rechecks that current Hitpoints exceed 8 before every dispatch. The four
Regicide leaf rows now also retain the same pending edge through failure and recovery. Offline game-cache
inspection confirms the near-side `Jump;Leaves;3925` anchors and the separate two-by-two pits whose
`Climb;Protruding rocks;3927` anchors begin at `(2313,9656)`, `(2336,9656)`, `(2354,9656)` and
`(2354,9643)`, all on plane zero. The resolver selects only the exact object within the player's
current pit, even if HP loss removes the original jump from the filtered catalogue. Returning to the
exact original surface tile permits a new jump only above 18 current HP; only the opposite destination
clears the crossing. Five failed jumps exhaust the retry budget after climbing out, not while stranded
below. Missing/rejected/timed-out recovery stops without issuing an unrelated ground walk in the pit.
The strict route policy rejects missing quest/skill gates instead of falling through generic agility
classification. These four restored rows remain live-deferred: verify the actual fall position and
same-side return in both directions, then normal success, low-HP refusal and cancellation.

Leaf recovery validation: compilation, 692 navigation/transport/toggle/guardrail tests and both
Checkstyle tasks passed. The client-thread baseline remains 903 with no new exemptions. No game
input was issued and no live acceptance is claimed; the Agent Server was unavailable during this batch.

Six unique post-quest Darkmeyer wall directions are restored with 63 Agility, completed Sins of the
Father and both permanent-rope varbits (`10449=1`, `10450=1`). The catalogue's construction-state
objects `39541`/`39542` are matched only to their corresponding installed live transforms
`39166`/`39168`; no long rope is banked or consumed during traversal. Duplicate source rows were
removed, exact landing is required, and physical acceptance remains deferred.

Twelve Spirits of the Elid crevice approaches are restored with exact object, quest-stage and
landing contracts. Each descent consumes one rope, while a separate reusable requirement accepts
the full lit-light-source collection from Quest Helper; pathfinding and bank setup therefore require
both and repeated descents sum ropes without withdrawing duplicate lanterns. The entry is unavailable
before quest stage 40, remains available after quest completion, and is live-deferred.

Five Cerberus Iron Winch approaches are restored with a strict members-only access contract:
currently boosted 91 Slayer, a positive assignment count, and an exact live task resolved as either
Hellhounds or Cerberus. Transport-refresh snapshots include the precise Slayer target and boss
subtype so changing between nonzero tasks invalidates a cached route; the scene resolver repeats
the access check on the client thread immediately before exposing `Turn`. NavigationEngine retains
the edge until its exact lair landing, and physical acceptance remains deferred.

Four permanently roped Lumbridge Swamp dark-hole approaches are restored with exact object,
installed-rope varbit and underground-landing contracts. Route availability and bank setup share a
reusable gas-safe light requirement; lit torches, candles, black candles and oil lamps are excluded
because they can ignite cave gas. The exact Lumbridge Fire of Eternal Light varbit (`6533=1`)
publishes separate light-free route variants. When varbit `279=0`, NavigationEngine stages one
consumable rope on the exact dark hole, waits for its installed transform and then owns the same
directed descent; bank planning also supplies a gas-safe light unless the permanent fire is built.
Physical acceptance remains deferred.

Four Grim Tales witch-house manhole approaches are restored only when permanent unlock varbit
`3718=1` is present. They carry no invented quest, item or combat requirement: NavigationEngine
owns the exact `Enter` interaction and basement landing, while the walker neither unlocks the
manhole nor owns survival in the aggressive experiment area. Physical acceptance remains deferred.

The complete focused Phase 6 banking, League, transport, navigation, pathfinder, POH, collision and
minimap suite passes, as do main and test Checkstyle. Existing deprecation warnings are unrelated.

## Final unusual-access and direct-route audit - 2026-09-08

The latest combined audit reduces the production classifier from 120 to **65** remaining entries:
42 ordinary `TRANSPORT` rows and the unchanged 23 deferred `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` rows. Eight exact
miscellaneous direct routes now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership, including the staged
Draynor manhole, Rat Pits and Witchaven access, the Grand Tree/Glough trees and the Stronghold
entrance. Six unusual-access routes now use the same lifecycle for the Lovakengj mine cart,
Sophanem hole, Trollweiss crevasse and Stronghold entrance/exit; nine more exact access routes cover
Beneath Cursed Sands rubble, the Chasm of Fire, Darkmeyer walls, the Myths' Guild statue and the
Weiss smelly hole.

Fifty-five unsafe, obsolete or incompletely gated rows were removed from the runtime graph rather
than exposed speculatively. These include always-failing or damaging climbs, equipment-preparation
rows not yet modelled, obsolete God Wars and Dorgesh-Kaan objects, active-task-only passages,
quest-time puzzle objects, duplicate vines, and rifts whose permanent unlock or equipment
restrictions are absent from their source contracts. OSRS Wiki/cache MCP evidence and focused
exact-policy, source-shape, landing, toggle and classifier tests cover the batch; **91 focused tests
pass**. No newly migrated physical traversal is claimed live-complete.

## Steps, access routes and audited shortcut cleanup - 2026-09-08

The latest combined audit reduces the production classifier from 181 to **97** remaining ordinary
`TRANSPORT` entries; the 23 deferred `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries are unchanged, for **120 total**.
Exact NavigationEngine catalogue ownership now covers the audited Steps, Shayzien handholds,
Jiggig and Grimstone/Grim Tales obstacles; Brimhaven, Miscellania and Troll Stronghold shortcuts;
Another Slice station doorways, Quetzacalli gates, Draynor bookcases, Troll exits and Ardougne
pick-lock doors; plus Mountain Camp rockslides, Crabclaw sand exits, the Myreque low fence and
Guardians of the Rift rubble. The one-tile low-fence row is deliberately admitted before the
generic scene-distance guard while still requiring its exact directed route and landing.

OSRS Wiki MCP evidence pins the Mountain Daughter, Royal Trouble, Troll Stronghold, Zogre Flesh
Eaters, Another Slice of H.A.M., Temple of the Eye and agility requirements used by these rows.
Rows whose safe protocol is still absent remain source-disabled, including task-only Wyvern steps,
blocking Jiggig barricades, setup-dependent bridges/ropes, quest-time trapdoors/prison doors,
failure-prone Lighthouse and Karamja shortcuts, and shadow duplicates already represented by the
agility catalogue. Focused policy, source-shape, config-toggle, exact-landing and classifier tests
cover this headless batch; none of these physical traversals is newly live-accepted.

## Audited boundary, boss-exit and unsafe-access cleanup - 2026-09-08

Twenty-five exact ordinary transitions now use NavigationEngine catalogue ownership: four Mort
Myre tree crossings, four Grand Tree roots, three outward Plague City mud piles, six Cerberus and
Scorpia boss exits, four Edgeville odd-wall crossings, both post-Monkey-Madness-II Crash Site
openings, and both Lumber Yard broken-fence directions. Each family is pinned to its exact directed
geometry, object/action identity, requirements and observed destination; the route scanner keeps
ownership until that destination is reached.

Fourteen incomplete or malformed source rows no longer enter the runtime graph. These are four
equipped-sled Trollweiss slopes, five Resource Area gate rows then lacking a payment protocol
(their fares were correctly directed; see the 2026-09-09 correction), one remote odd-wall duplicate that conflicts with the canonical goo-vine route, and four
southern Brimhaven rope approaches that omit Banisoch's one-time 5,000-trading-stick unlock. OSRS
Wiki/cache MCP evidence and focused policy, source-shape, classification and landing tests cover the
batch. The classifier floor is now **204 legacy entries**: 181 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries. Physical traversal of migrated routes remains pending, and disabled
rows are implementation work rather than live-only deferrals.

## Haunted Mine, Slayer Tower and unsafe-environment cleanup - 2026-09-08

Eighteen exact transitions now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. Five Haunted Mine dark
stairs preserve their reusable glowing-fungus requirement, and the five flooded-lift approaches
require completed Haunted Mine. Eight medium Slayer Tower chains require 61 Agility and retain
ownership across their documented 2-5-damage failure because failure still reaches the directed
opposite floor.

Thirty-two incomplete or unusable ordinary rows are now source-only: failure-prone Slayer Tower
floors and Regicide leaf traps; asymmetric eastern Brimhaven stepping stones; rope/light/gas-gated
Lumbridge and Smoke Dungeon entrances; Grim Tales basement manholes; Karuulm heat barriers; and
four Old School Museum passageway props whose Leave action cannot transport the player. Wiki/cache
MCP evidence and focused source, policy and landing tests cover every group. The classifier floor
is now **241 legacy entries**: 218 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.
Physical traversal of migrated routes remains pending.

## Access doors, cart tunnels and hazard-route pruning - 2026-09-08

Eighteen exact direct boundaries now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. Four Ranging Guild
doors preserve the members and 40-Ranged entry contract, two Dorgesh-Kaan bone doors require
`Death to the Dorgeshuun=FINISHED`, and two western Forthos temple doors preserve unlock varbit
8397. Eight Haunted Mine cart-tunnel rows are split between completed Priest in Peril access and
the completed-Haunted-Mine crystal shortcut. Both Fortis Colosseum entrances require members,
`Children of the Sun=FINISHED`, and complete only at the underground lobby landing.

Eighteen unsafe rows are now source-only: Harmony Island gas/state doors, quest-time Ancient
Pyramid doors, mismatched open-state Pyramid doorways, and eight cave tunnels whose routes omit
light-source, insect-damage or fire-state safety. Wiki and cache MCP evidence pins the identities,
requirements and exclusions; focused source, policy, classification and exact-landing tests cover
the batch. The classifier floor is now **291 legacy entries**: 268 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries. Physical traversal remains pending.

## Weiss post-quest routes, guide NPCs and stale portal duplicates - 2026-09-08

Seven completed-Making Friends with My Arm Weiss routes now use exact catalogue/NavigationEngine
ownership: two fallen-tree, two little-boulder and three cleared-cave approaches. Four unsafe Weiss
ledge/rope rows remain only as source evidence because their 68 Agility, setup, damage and fallback
stages are absent. Ten deterministic guide routes now use the direct NPC lifecycle: six post-Death
to the Dorgeshuun Dartog/Mistag/Kazgar destinations, two quest-gated Elkoy crossings and two
unlock-gated Auburn Mountain Guide crossings. Their members, NPC-form, quest and variable gates are
frozen by exact tests.

Five duplicate Runecrafting portal rows are source-disabled because the Wiki/cache contract exposes
`Use`, while those rows encoded `Enter`; canonical `Use` exits remain available. This batch removes
23 more legacy classifications while adding 17 exact engine-owned routes; three corrected Dorgesh
rows collapse onto their canonical post-quest contracts rather than contributing separate legacy
edges. The classifier floor is now **327 legacy entries**: 304 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Unsafe access gates and Weiss rockslides - 2026-09-08

Sixteen incomplete catalogue rows are now source-only. Five God Wars Dungeon boulder rows omitted
the members/60 Strength gate, five Cerberus winch rows omitted 91 Slayer plus an active hellhound
or Cerberus task, and six Weiss rockslides omitted their asymmetric 68 Agility ascent requirement
and failed-climb damage/recovery. OSRS Wiki and cache MCP checks pin the exact object identities and
requirements; exact source-shape tests prove none of these unsafe rows loads at runtime.

The remaining 23 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` rows were separately audited: 20 Max cape, two Camulet and
one Hunter cape Black-chinchompa row. They remain deferred because grouped worn/inventory menus,
setting-dependent Max-cape Home behavior, shared five-per-day Hunter counters, Camulet charges and
the Wilderness confirmation are not all encoded. No item row was promoted on incomplete evidence.
The classifier floor is now **350 legacy entries**: 327 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Unsafe incomplete shortcut cleanup - 2026-09-08

Thirty-two catalogue rows are now retained only as commented source evidence and no longer enter
the runtime graph. OSRS Wiki MCP checks established that ten Ghosts Ahoy rock jumps require 25
Agility, at least 5% run energy and failure/damage recovery; eight Darkmeyer wall rows omit the
63-Agility, Sins of the Father access and permanent two-long-rope setup; eight Royal Trouble
stepping-stone rows omit selecting and using a plank on the rocks; and six Regicide stick rows can
fail and deal damage. These are explicit unsupported protocols, not migrated coverage or live-only
deferrals, and may return only with the missing requirements, staging and recovery modelled.

MCP-backed source-shape and zero-runtime-load tests cover each removed group. The classifier floor
is now **366 legacy entries**: 343 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Post-quest tunnels/caves and stale entrance cleanup - 2026-09-08

Nineteen exact post-quest boundaries now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. Seven tunnel
rows cover the Ancient Pyramid rear (`Desert Treasure I=FINISHED`), the Miscellania dungeon pair
(`Royal Trouble=FINISHED`), and four Lumbridge cave holes (`The Lost Tribe=FINISHED`). Four western
Ice Troll Cave approaches require `The Fremennik Isles=FINISHED`, and four Myreque wooden-door
routes require `In Search of the Myreque=FINISHED`. Every row is members-only and completes only at
its directed landing.

Fifteen invalid or incomplete entrance rows are retained as commented evidence but removed from
the runtime graph: three eastern Ice Troll entrances contradict the documented post-quest western
access, two Shade Catacombs doors omit the required shade-key contract, and 14 obsolete Brimhaven
Dungeon rows use superseded object IDs while conflating the 875-coin payment, temporary opening and
permanent-access states. The latter needs a dedicated current-object payment protocol rather than
legacy data reuse. MCP-backed source-shape, policy, classifier and exact-landing tests pass. The
classifier floor is now **398 legacy entries**: 375 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Wintertodt gaps, Enakhra barriers, and ambiguous Kharazi cleanup - 2026-09-08

All six Wintertodt pillar-gap routes now use exact catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership with 60
Agility, members-only metadata, the agility-shortcut configuration gate, and failure-aware pending
retention until the directed landing. Six members-only Enakhra magic barriers are also exact
post-quest transitions gated by `Enakhra's Lament=FINISHED`; this deliberately excludes the
quest-time four-puzzle/Lazim flow.

Sixteen Kharazi jungle rows are now retained only as commented audit evidence and absent from the
runtime graph. They represented eight identical origin/object inputs with two different declared
destinations, so one Chop-down click could not prove which edge had been selected. The remaining
76 jungle obstacles have one deterministic destination per input. Focused policy, source-shape,
failure-retention, feature-toggle, classifier and route tests pass. The classifier floor is now
**432 legacy entries**: 409 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Ice Queen rock slides, Stronghold tunnel, and Weiss exits - 2026-09-08

Six canonical Ice Queen's Lair rock-slide routes now use exact catalogue/NavigationEngine
ownership. They require a members world, `Heroes' Quest=FINISHED`, 50 Mining and one reusable
pickaxe from the existing alternative set; four older rows that omitted the quest, level and
canonical landings remain only as commented malformed evidence. The ten-tick transition window
allows the single Mine action to clear and cross the respawning slide without surrendering
ownership.

Both Stronghold Slayer Cave tunnel approaches now require 72 Agility, are members-only, respect
the web-walker agility-shortcut toggle, and retain ownership to their exact landing. Five Weiss
`Descend;Hole;33227` approaches are likewise exact members-only transitions gated by
`Making Friends with My Arm=FINISHED`. Wiki MCP and cache identities back all three contracts;
focused policy, feature-toggle, classifier and route-publication tests pass. The classifier floor
is now **460 legacy entries**: 437 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Killerwatt and unlocked Catacombs passages - 2026-09-08

Six exact members-only unlocked passages now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. The two
Killerwatt-plane rifts require `Ernest the Chicken=FINISHED`; three Forthos Dungeon strange
passages retain unlock varbit 5087, and the Giants' Den passage retains unlock varbit 12341. The
directed manifest also preserves their distinct durations and landings, so an unrelated rift or
same-named passage cannot widen the policy. MCP-backed policy, scanner, classifier and route tests
pass, reducing the then-current floor to **477 legacy entries**: 454 ordinary and 23 item rows.

## Direct outward exits, Camdozaal, and Ice Path safety - 2026-09-08

Six exact members-only outward dungeon exits now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. Their
source-side presence proves the player has already reached the enclosed area, so entrance-only
quest or setup requirements are not copied onto these one-way exits; the directed tuple still pins
the exact object, action and surface landing.

Both free-to-play Camdozaal boundary rows now require `Below Ice Mountain=FINISHED`, matching the
Wiki MCP evidence that the ruins become accessible after quest completion. The 11 Ice Path gate
rows are retained only as commented audit evidence and are absent from the runtime graph: clicking
the gate enters an extreme-cold area that drains stats and disables running, which needs a
route-wide safety contract rather than a generic door interaction. Focused tests pin the six/two
exact manifests, quest and members metadata, and the absence of Ice Path rows. Together with the
Quetzal-whistle cutover below, the classifier floor is now **483 legacy entries**: 460 ordinary
`TRANSPORT` and 23 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries; physical acceptance remains pending.

## Quetzal whistle destination-map teleports - 2026-09-08

All 14 Quetzal whistle rows now use the item-teleport/NavigationEngine lifecycle: open the
inventory tab, issue exact `Signal`, select the exact destination from whistle interface 949, and
retain ownership until the directed landing. The saved direct-to-Hunter-Guild setting varbit 19681
is required to be zero; the walker preserves a nonzero user setting and declines these map routes
instead of guessing a destination or changing the setting. The six existing destination-build
varbits remain mandatory, and hidden or struck-through destination widgets are never clicked.

Basic, enhanced and perfected whistles expose the same inventory-only action and hold stored
charges without changing item ID. Banking therefore withdraws one reusable physical whistle across
repeated route edges rather than one whistle per stored charge. An exhausted whistle cannot open
the destination stage and remains subject to bounded NavigationEngine command recovery; exact
per-item charge preflight remains a live acceptance branch because no client varbit or item-ID
variant exposes the stored count. Focused policy, route-publication and banking checks are included.
The classifier floor is now **502 legacy entries**: 479 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 23
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries. Physical charged, final-charge, exhausted and delayed-map cases remain
live-deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Lithkren broken doors and unsafe shadow-route cleanup - 2026-09-08

Nine exact members-only Broken Grandiose Doors routes now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership
after `Dragon Slayer II=FINISHED`. This deliberately excludes the quest-time dragon-key unlock and
freezes both object IDs 32117/32132 across their distinct directed landings.

Twelve redundant ordinary Magic Mushtree rows are runtime-disabled in favour of the dedicated
discovery-aware mushtree network. Twelve Karuulm elevator/stairs rows are also retained only as
commented evidence because the catalogue omits the route-wide boot-or-elite-diary heat protection;
admitting the click alone could route an account into four-damage-per-tick flooring. These 24 rows
are not claimed as migrated coverage. The classifier floor is now **516 legacy entries**: 479
ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 37 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Stronghold escape routes and Wintertodt doors - 2026-09-08

Fourteen direct Stronghold of Security vertical/escape rows and all 16 Wintertodt door rows now use
exact catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. The Stronghold manifest admits only the documented
Dripping vine, Goo covered vine and Bone Chain identities, including three duplicate catalogue
rows, and explicitly excludes the same-ID Dragon Slayer II/Lithkren vine.

Wintertodt rows are corrected to members-only. The seven inbound prison routes retain 50
Firemaking, while the seven outward routes and two lobby boundaries remain requirement-free so a
player already inside can leave. Cache identities and OSRS Wiki MCP evidence pin both families;
exact landings remain the completion signal. The classifier floor is now **549 legacy entries**:
512 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 37 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Paid/setup crevice removal and post-quest entrances - 2026-09-08

Two incomplete crevice families are retained as commented audit evidence but no longer enter the
runtime graph. The 16 Revenant Caves object-40386 rows omitted the 100,000-coin entry confirmation
and paid-since-last-death state; the 12 Spirits of the Elid object-10416 rows omitted installed-rope,
light-source and quest-access state. Neither family is claimed as migrated coverage.

Twenty-two deterministic post-quest entries now use exact catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership.
Twelve F2P Crandor object-25154 approaches require `Dragon Slayer I=FINISHED`; ten members-only
Shilo object-2216 cart crossings require `Shilo Village=FINISHED`, excluding its pre-quest Search
and dialogue flow. MCP-backed cache identities, exact directed manifests and requirement checks
prevent the same action/name from widening to unrelated holes or carts. The classifier floor is now
**579 legacy entries**: 542 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 37 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Stale and malformed agility catalogue cleanup - 2026-09-08

The final ten legacy `AGILITY_SHORTCUT` rows were removed after OSRS Wiki MCP and current cache
evidence showed that none represented a safe current traversal. Eight object-16533 River Lum rows
encoded the obsolete four-stone geometry replaced in April 2026; the replacement one-stone crossing
needs current directed endpoints and failure-landings captured before it is added.

The Mountain Camp row used unicorn horn 237 instead of rope 954 and conflated one-time Mountain
Daughter setup with repeat traversal; its duplicate ordinary object-5842 setup row was also removed.
The Observatory object-31850 row similarly conflated permanent rope setup with traversal while
omitting its quest, stats, equipment and persistent unlock state. These are unsupported-family data
removals, not migrated coverage. Every remaining loaded agility row is engine-owned, and the
classifier floor is now **629 legacy entries**: 592 ordinary `TRANSPORT` and 37
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Random Wilderness obelisk catalogue disabled - 2026-09-08

The 318 generated `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` edges are no longer loaded into the runtime graph and the
configuration defaults off. The retained source resource expands 54 pad inputs into 270 remote
permutations plus 48 unsafe same-pad artifacts, but ordinary activation chooses a random remote pad;
therefore those rows do not describe deterministic directed routes that NavigationEngine can own.
Persisted opt-in settings cannot re-enable the removed runtime edges.

The correct future contract is a separate hard-Wilderness-diary protocol that selects a destination
before activation and verifies the observed landing. This audit is an unsupported-family removal,
not migrated or live-complete obelisk coverage. The classifier floor is now **640 legacy entries**:
593 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, and 37 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries.

## Golem, Sophanem and Trollweiss quest-gated entrances - 2026-09-08

Fifty exact members-only entrances now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership: 12 Golem portal
approaches on object 6310, 12 eastern Sophanem rock approaches on object 6621, and 26 Troll Romance
tunnel approaches on objects 5008, 5009 and 5011-5014. OSRS Wiki MCP identifies the cache contracts
as `golem_portal`, `ics_little_entrance_multi` and the distinct `trollromance_*` tunnel objects; the
quest guides confirm the underlying access flows. The resource conservatively requires completion
of The Golem, Icthlarin's Little Helper and Troll Romance respectively, rather than exposing
quest-time variants whose intermediate setup state is not represented.

The immutable directed manifest freezes every origin, destination, object, action and catalogue
name. It does not broaden generic Door, Rock or Tunnel handling, and only the selected remote
landing clears the pending transition. Focused policy, scanner, route-publication and classifier
tests pass. The classifier floor is now **958 legacy entries**: 593 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10
`AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 37 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318 `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Representative
post-quest crossings and interruption recovery remain live-deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Crafting Guild Max cape teleport - 2026-09-08

The one exact `Max cape: Crafting Guild` row now uses the item-teleport/NavigationEngine lifecycle.
OSRS Wiki MCP and item-action cache verification identify inventory Max cape 13280's `Crafting
Guild` submenu action and the worn Max cape 13342's direct `Crafting Guild` action. The remaining
20 Max cape rows stay legacy-owned because Home is setting-dependent, several destinations require
grouped equipment menus, and the Feldip Hills and Black chinchompa teleports have daily limits not
represented by a reliable availability predicate.

The route remains non-consumable, so bank planning requests one reusable cape across repeated
edges. Exact destination `(2931,3286,0)`, both valid item forms, metadata and action surfaces are
frozen; only the directed Crafting Guild landing acknowledges completion. Focused item-policy,
scanner, banking, route-publication and classifier tests pass. The classifier floor is now **1,008
legacy entries**: 643 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 37 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318
`WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Inventory, worn and bank-only acceptance remain live-deferred, so
Phase 6 remains open.

## Outward rope-exit transitions - 2026-09-08

Fifteen exact outward rope exits now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership: three Lumbridge
Swamp Cave rows on object 5946, four free-to-play Crandor rows on object 25213, four Water Ravine/
Elid rows on object 10434, the Giant Mole exit on object 12230, and three God Wars Dungeon rows on
object 26370. OSRS Wiki MCP confirms that rope installation, light-source, quest and first-entry
requirements belong to entering these areas; presence at each outward source already proves access.
The members flags are corrected on the 11 members-only rows while Crandor remains free-to-play.

The immutable directed manifest excludes every reverse entrance and all same-name ropes elsewhere.
NavigationEngine retains each command through the plane/region transition and only the exact remote
surface landing clears it. Focused policy, scanner, route-publication and classifier tests pass.
The classifier floor is now **1,009 legacy entries**: 643 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10
`AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 38 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318 `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Representative
exits and combat/external-movement recovery remain live-deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Witchaven, Wyvern Cave and Miscellania climb-up exits - 2026-09-08

All seven exact `Climb-up;Exit` rows now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership: one Witchaven
Dungeon exit on object 18354, two Fossil Island Wyvern Cave exits on object 30844, and four
Miscellania and Etceteria dungeon exits on object 15193. OSRS Wiki MCP confirms all three dungeons
are members-only, and cache names bind the three IDs to their specific exit families. The seven
missing members flags are corrected.

No entrance-only quest, task or varbit requirement is copied onto these outward routes: a player
already inside must remain able to leave. Exact directed keys prevent the same verbs from enabling
unrelated exits, and only the selected remote surface landing acknowledges completion. Focused
policy, scanner, route-publication and classifier tests pass. The classifier floor is now **1,024
legacy entries**: 658 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 38 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and
318 `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Representative crossings and interruption recovery remain live-
deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Ferox, Wilderness Slayer and Isle of Souls opening exits - 2026-09-08

All 11 exact `Exit;Opening` rows now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership: three Ferox Enclave
dungeon approaches to object 39648, seven Wilderness Slayer Cave approaches to objects 40389/
40391, and one Isle of Souls Dungeon approach to object 40737. OSRS Wiki MCP identifies all three
dungeons as members content and the cache names tie each object ID to its named exit. Nine rows
whose members flag was absent are corrected; no item, currency, skill, quest or state requirement
is invented.

The exact directed keys keep these long-distance exits separate from unrelated objects named
Opening, and only the selected surface landing acknowledges each interaction. Focused policy,
scanner, route-publication and classifier tests pass. The classifier floor is now **1,031 legacy
entries**: 665 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 38 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318
`WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Representative Ferox, Wilderness Slayer and Isle of Souls exits—
including combat/external-movement recovery—remain live-deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Karamja Volcano entrance and return transitions - 2026-09-08

All 12 exact Karamja Volcano surface/dungeon transitions now use catalogue/NavigationEngine
ownership: eight `Climb-down;Rocks;11441` approaches and four `Climb;Climbing rope;18969`
returns. OSRS Wiki MCP and packaged-route verification confirm that this is the public volcano
entrance, with no item, skill, quest, currency or members requirement on these entrance objects;
the Dragon Slayer restriction applies deeper toward Crandor and is not copied onto this boundary.

The frozen directed manifest prevents the generic Rocks or Climbing rope names from admitting
unrelated routes. Each interaction remains pending through the cross-plane transition and clears
only at its selected surface or dungeon landing. Focused policy, scanner, route-publication and
classifier tests pass. The classifier floor is now **1,042 legacy entries**: 676 ordinary
`TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 38 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318 `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries.
Representative down/up crossings and recovery from aggressive dungeon-side interruption remain
live-deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Chronicle and Jaltevas charged-container teleports - 2026-09-08

The Chronicle and final Pharaoh's sceptre destination now use the exact item-teleport/
NavigationEngine lifecycle. OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms Chronicle 13660 exposes direct
inventory and worn `Teleport`, spends one stored card charge, cannot work anywhere in the
Wilderness, and retains the reusable book. Its catalog ceiling is corrected from 19 to 0.
PathfinderConfig no longer clicks `Check charges` while calculating a route: it reads the saved
Item Charges value only, safely rejects missing/malformed/zero state, and can recognize a banked
Chronicle when bank items are enabled. Banking withdraws one book rather than one book per edge.

The MCP identifies both 26948 and 26950 as charged Pharaoh's sceptres and varbit 13839 as
`pharaohs_sceptre_necropolis`. All four sceptre rows now accept either charged form, Jaltevas alone
requires `13839=1`, and the charged sceptre is treated as one reusable container across repeated
edges. A source guard now prevents route configuration from issuing inventory/equipment input.
Focused policy, banking, route-publication, architecture and classifier tests pass. The classifier
floor is now **1,054 legacy entries**: 688 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 38
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318 `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Inventory/worn/banked use and exhausted-
charge rejection remain live-deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Calcified moth and Slepe medallion teleports - 2026-09-08

The Calcified moth and `Drakan's medallion: Slepe` rows now use the exact item-teleport/
NavigationEngine lifecycle. OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms that item 29090 is a stackable,
single-use `Crush` teleport to Cam Torum with a level-20 Wilderness ceiling. The existing catalog
gate remains conservatively at completed Perilous Moons even though the Wiki documents an earlier
partial-quest permission point; this avoids publishing the edge before the exact quest-stage value
is represented.

The Slepe destination uses reusable medallion 22400 with exact `Slepe` inventory/equipment actions.
The cache identifies varbit 12416 as `slepe_teleport_unlocked`, matching the Wiki requirement to use
a Slepey tablet on the medallion, so the row now requires `12416=1`. Banking therefore sums one moth
per route use but only one medallion across repeated Slepe edges. Focused item-policy, banking,
route-publication and classifier tests pass. The classifier floor is now **1,056 legacy entries**:
688 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 40 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318
`WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Inventory/equipped/banked Slepe use and banked moth consumption remain
live-deferred, so Phase 6 remains open.

## Mor Ul Rek hot-vent doors - 2026-09-08

All 11 exact Inner Mor Ul Rek `Pass;Hot vent door;30266` rows now use catalogue/
NavigationEngine ownership. OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms the direct `Pass` action and that
entry to the inner city requires a Fire cape or Fire max cape. The catalog now marks these rows
members-only and accepts the normal and trouver Fire cape / Fire max cape variants (6570, 13329,
24134 and 24223) as one reusable alternative group. Route planning can therefore use a carried,
worn or banked cape; repeated barriers require only one withdrawal, and dispatch rechecks that a
cape remains available before issuing the object interaction.

The exact 11-route manifest excludes Fight Pits hot-vent IDs 11844-11846 and retains directed
two-tile landing acknowledgement. The Wiki also documents that the cape is no longer needed after
the player has passed the barrier once, but no reliable local varbit/varplayer for that permanent
unlock was found; this cutover conservatively continues to require a cape instead of guessing the
unlock. Focused policy, scanner, banking, route-publication and classifier tests pass. The
classifier floor is now **1,058 legacy entries**, comprising 688 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10
`AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 42 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318 `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. Physical
carried/worn/banked crossings and the permanent-unlock-without-cape branch remain live-deferred, so
Phase 6 remains open.

## Water Obelisk grapple and barehand shortcut - 2026-09-08

The one-way Water Obelisk-to-Catherby Crossbow Tree route now uses catalogue/NavigationEngine
ownership. OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms live object 17062 exposes `Grapple`, not the
packaged `Grapple Crossbow` text, and cannot be used in the reverse direction. The resource action
is corrected and the original 36 Agility / 39 Ranged / 22 Strength variant remains available only
with mith grapple 9419 in the ammunition slot and a compatible equipped crossbow.

A second exact variant models the documented 72 Agility barehand crossing without inventing an
item, Ranged or Strength requirement. The variants remain separate so a banked or inventory-only
grapple cannot enable the equipped route, while a qualifying barehanded player is not forced to
carry tools. Both publish the same one-way directed interaction and clear only at the Catherby-side
landing. Focused policy, scanner, route-publication and classifier tests pass. The classifier floor
is now **1,069 legacy entries**, comprising 699 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 42
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318 `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries; no `GRAPPLE_SHORTCUT` remains legacy.
Physical equipped/barehand crossing and grapple-break recovery remain live-deferred, so Phase 6
remains open.

## Already-equipped grapple shortcuts - 2026-09-08

Eleven exact `Grapple` rows now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership: the two Broken Raft
directions, Falador and Yanille walls, Catherby rocks, and four Karamja Strong Tree links. Their
directed geometry, object/name/action identity, skill levels and packaged grapple requirements are
frozen. The later Water Obelisk correction above supersedes that row's earlier deferral.

OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms that mith grapple 9419 must be equipped in the ammo slot and a
compatible crossbow must be equipped in the weapon slot; the love crossbow and ballistae do not
qualify, and a grapple can break on use. Pathfinder publication and live scene resolution both
recheck the equipped state, so inventory-only or bank-only tools cannot select these edges and a
broken/removed grapple makes the route unavailable. This slice does not equip or restore either
slot and does not claim the higher-Agility barehand variants.

Focused equipment, policy, scanner and classifier tests plus both Checkstyle tasks pass. The
classifier floor is now **1,070 legacy entries**, comprising 699 ordinary `TRANSPORT`, 10
`AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, one `GRAPPLE_SHORTCUT`, 42 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318
`WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. The integrated walker and pathfinder-policy regression passed **827**
tests with zero failures, errors or skips; compile and the whitespace check also pass. Physical
representative crossings and break recovery remain deferred, so this is headless-complete and
Phase 6 remains open.

## Unlimited Ardougne Farm cape teleport - 2026-09-08

The `Ardougne cloak: Farm` row now uses the engine-owned reusable item-teleport lifecycle, narrowed
to Ardougne cloak 4 (13124) and Ardougne max cape (20760). OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms that
both inherit unlimited teleports to the Ardougne farming patch and expose `Farm Teleport` in the
inventory and `Ardougne Farm` when worn. Cloaks 2 and 3 are removed from this route because their
three/five daily limits are not represented by a reliable availability predicate.

The resource now correctly marks the two retained variants non-consumable, so repeated selected
edges require one reusable cape rather than one withdrawal per use. Exact destination, metadata,
item alternatives and both action surfaces are frozen; the normal item-teleport scanner retains
NavigationEngine ownership until the directed farm landing. Focused item-action, banking, scanner
and classifier tests pass. The classifier floor is now **1,081 legacy entries**, including **42**
legacy `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` entries. The integrated walker regression passed **818** tests with zero
failures, errors or skips; compile, both Checkstyle tasks and the whitespace check pass. Physical
inventory/worn and bank-only acceptance is deferred, so this is headless-complete and Phase 6
remains open.

## Abyss guaranteed passages - 2026-09-08

All 12 exact `Go-through;Passage;26250` outer-Abyss configurations now use the catalogue/
NavigationEngine lifecycle. The frozen directed manifest preserves all 12 unique origins and their
three packaged inner-ring landings; exact route identity is required because the same object ID can
lead to different destinations. The policy also freezes the absence of item, currency, skill,
quest, varbit and varplayer requirements rather than broadly admitting objects named Passage.

OSRS Wiki MCP verification identifies Passage as guaranteed with no tool and documents exactly 12
random outer-ring obstacle configurations. Runtime resolution nevertheless requires object 26250
at the selected origin, and only the selected directed landing clears the pending interaction;
another Passage landing cannot acknowledge it. Focused policy, scanner and classifier checks plus
both Checkstyle tasks pass. The integrated walker regression passed **817** tests with zero failures,
errors or skips. The classifier floor is now **1,082 legacy entries**, including **699** ordinary
`TRANSPORT` entries. Physical verification remains deferred because the outer Abyss is aggressive
multicombat territory, so this is headless-complete and Phase 6 remains open.

## Fairy Resistance Hideout sequence - 2026-09-08

All 53 generated `AIR DLR DJQ AJS` fan-in rows now use the fairy-ring/NavigationEngine lifecycle.
OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms the exact four-code order: AIR reaches the south-east Ardougne
island, DLR reaches the Poison Waste island, DJQ intentionally goes nowhere, and AJS reaches the
hideout. The resource is conservatively gated on Fairytale II `FINISHED`; this avoids selecting the
quest-time form that additionally needs Nuff's certificate, while retaining any stricter quest
requirements inherited from the source ring.

The four commands remain one immutable pending route interaction. Each intermediate command must
close the interface and reach its exact expected landing before the next code can be staged; DJQ
therefore acknowledges the unchanged DLR-island position only after its own interface transition.
The final AJS command still requires the directed hideout landing, and the originally equipped
weapon is restored only after that final landing. No direct last-destination shortcut is used for
this sequence and no legacy movement owner is entered between its legs.

The integrated walker, banking, transport, seasonal, POH, cost and collision regression passed
**815** tests with zero failures, errors or skips; compile, both Checkstyle tasks and the whitespace
check pass. The classifier floor is now **1,094 legacy entries**, comprising 711 ordinary
`TRANSPORT`, 10 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT`, 12 `GRAPPLE_SHORTCUT`, 43 `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` and 318
`WILDERNESS_OBELISK` entries. No ordinary `FAIRY_RING` row remains legacy-owned. Physical sequence
acceptance remains in the live backlog, so this slice is headless-complete and Phase 6 remains open.

## Shantay pass gates - 2026-09-08

All 14 packaged `Go-through;Shantay pass` rows now use the catalogue/NavigationEngine interaction
lifecycle: six consumable-ticket entries, the main gate's two intentional 5-coin alternatives, and
six free return crossings. The exact directed manifest covers the main pass object 4031 and Unkah
object 41326. The engine rechecks the carried pass at dispatch, retains the pending gate after the
ticket is consumed, and clears it only after crossing the route's directed axis boundary.

At the main pass only, a missing ticket with at least five coins advances through the catalogued
Shantay NPC 4642's exact `Buy-pass` action before `Go-through`; this is non-blocking and requires the
live NPC/action to be present. Unkah has no verified local vendor record, so coin-only purchase is
not invented there: a ticket must be carried or withdrawn, unless the Desert Elite exemption makes
entry free. OSRS Wiki MCP verification confirms the main gate's five-coin purchase and Desert Elite
free-entry rules, and identifies the two Unkah passes without identifying an equivalent Unkah
ticket vendor. The broad walker regression passed **812** tests with zero failures, errors or skips;
compile, both Checkstyle tasks and the whitespace check also pass. This lowers the current classifier
floor to **1,147 legacy entries**, including **711** ordinary `TRANSPORT` entries. Physical
main-gate purchase/ticket/free-return and representative Unkah crossings remain in the live backlog,
so this slice is headless-complete rather than live-complete and Phase 6 remains open.

## Max-cape duplicate route cleanup - 2026-09-08

One byte-for-byte duplicate `Max cape: Black chinchompa` row was removed. The remaining route data
still contains the same destination and item alternatives, so no reachability or executor behavior
changes; Max-cape menu ownership remains deferred. A fail-first resource regression observed 22
rows, and now pins 21 unique directed contracts. This lowers the loaded catalogue and classifier
floor by one to **1,161 legacy entries**, including **43** legacy item-teleport rows. Integrated
validation passed **561** banking, transport, navigation, seasonal, feature-gate, POH, cost and
collision tests with zero failures/errors/skips; compile, both Checkstyle tasks and the whitespace
check also pass.

## Mythical cape usable-item correction and cutover - 2026-09-08

The Mythical cape route now requires only usable capes 22114 or 24855; inert POH trophy item 21913
was removed from the resource requirement. Both retained variants expose exact inventory and worn
`Teleport` actions and now use the normal reusable item-teleport lifecycle to `(2457,2850,0)`.
Policy, action-fixture, banking and classifier regressions pass. This lowers the classifier floor to
**1,162 legacy entries**, including **44** item-teleport rows. Physical inventory/worn acceptance is
deferred; mounted POH cape support is not added or implied.

## Mokhaiotl waystone - 2026-09-08

The single `Mokhaiotl waystone: Channel` row now reuses the engine-owned consumable-item lifecycle.
The exact contract requires item 31099, completed Final Dawn, members, consumable status, duration
four, Wilderness ceiling 29, destination `(1311,9497,0)` and no additional skill/var/fare state.
Only the direct inventory action `Channel` is accepted; inert neighboring display variants and an
equipment action remain excluded. The fail-first policy and classifier checks reproduced legacy
ownership, then the focused item/scanner suite passed. The classifier floor is now **1,163 legacy
entries**, with **45** item-teleport rows still legacy-owned. Physical use remains deferred.

## Burning amulet Wilderness teleports - 2026-09-08

The three Burning amulet destinations—Chaos Temple, Bandit Camp and Lava Maze—now use the
engine-owned item-teleport lifecycle. Eligibility freezes the exact destination, all five charged
item IDs, members/consumable metadata, duration four, Wilderness ceiling 19 and absence of other
requirements. Both inventory subactions and worn actions use the exact destination label; no
generic `Rub`, jewellery-family or warning rule is enabled.

After the destination input, the same pending edge advances only when its scoped dialogue contains
`Okay, teleport to level`. The engine issues that affirmative once and retains ownership through a
charged-ID change or final item disappearance until the directed Wilderness landing is observed.
An unrelated `Yes` dialogue is never a fallback. The fail-first test reproduced the absent strict
contract; 75 focused policy, scanner and classifier tests then passed. The classifier floor is now
**1,164 legacy entries**, with **46** item-teleport rows still legacy-owned. Repeated-edge banking
remains deliberately conservative at one charged amulet per use until charge capacity is modelled.
Physical warning/landing acceptance is deferred and must use an intentionally minimal Wilderness
loadout; this headless cutover is not a safety claim.

## Alternate-destination teleport spells - 2026-09-08

All ten remaining `TELEPORTATION_SPELL` rows now use the engine-owned simple-teleport lifecycle:
eight `Teleport to House: Outside` locations, `Varrock Teleport: Grand Exchange`, and `Watchtower
Teleport: Yanille`. Admission is not a generic colon rule. It verifies each packaged destination,
standard spellbook, exact Magic level, member/quest shape, diary/location/toggle varbits, Watchtower
varplayer, duration and Wilderness limit. Dispatch maps each row to one canonical base spell, its
exact alternate option, and widget identifier 2; arbitrary and requirement-damaged variants remain
unsupported.

NavigationEngine retains ownership after the spell input until the directed alternate landing.
Bank planning continues to strip the suffix only for rune lookup: repeated House-Outside casts sum
Air, Earth and Law runes per use, while existing staff and combination-rune supply logic remains
shared. Focused policy, scanner, classifier and banking tests pass, reducing the classifier floor to
1,167 with no remaining legacy `TELEPORTATION_SPELL` rows. Representative physical acceptance is
deferred; House-Outside support proves only the surface destination, not a house instance or any
facility.

The integrated isolated-client validation covering banking, all walker transport and navigation
tests, seasonal transports, feature toggles, POH panel, cost model and live collision passed **556**
tests with zero failures, errors or skips. Main/test Checkstyle and `git diff --check` also pass; the
only diff output is the repository's existing line-ending conversion notices. The temporary build
output was removed after validation.

## Molch/Lizardman Temple one-way links - 2026-09-08

Eight `Enter;Lizard dwelling` approaches and eight `Jump-in;Strange hole` exits now use exact
catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. The manifest contains only object IDs 34402, 34403, 34405 and
34422 at their 16 packaged directed routes; sibling dwelling 34404 is not admitted because it has no
route row. Full route identity matters because ID 34403 serves two different temple interiors.

The rows have no item, skill, quest, var, fare, dialogue or setup requirements, and the one-way
dwelling/exit topology is retained rather than inventing reverse links. The fail-first regression
reproduced legacy classification, then 85 focused classifier, scanner and cache-backed scene tests
passed through the isolated client build. The floor is now 1,177 legacy entries, including 725
ordinary `TRANSPORT` entries. Physical crossings remain deferred because the temple area is
combat-adjacent; no shaman barrier acceptance is implied.

## Castle Wars random Guthix portal removal - 2026-09-08

The 12 object-4408 Guthix portal rows have been removed from routing data. They represented six
identical live inputs twice, once for each Castle Wars team room, even though the server selects the
smaller team and may choose randomly when team counts are equal. The current directed-edge model
therefore could not truthfully promise either destination. This is not lost reachability: deterministic
Saradomin object 4387 and Zamorak object 4388 still provide the same two waiting-room destinations.

A fail-first corpus regression observed 100 portal rows and then passes with exactly 88, all
engine-owned, no object-4408 route, and both deterministic destinations retained. Together with the
Swan Song hole cutover, the classifier floor is now 1,193 legacy entries, including 741 ordinary
`TRANSPORT` entries. Random-team support would require a new outcome-set interaction and immediate
replan from the observed landing; Phase 6 does not fabricate a directed result from that click.

## Swan Song island hole - 2026-09-08

The two directed `Enter;Hole;12656` rows between `(2344,3650,0)` and `(2344,3655,0)` now use
exact catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. Eligibility retains the packaged `Swan Song=FINISHED`
gate and rejects altered coordinates, requirements, identity or direction, so the other 12
Dragon Slayer quest-in-progress hole aliases remain legacy-owned. The cache-backed scene resolver
requires the exact hole object and NavigationEngine retains the interaction until the selected
five-tile landing is reached.

The fail-first regression reproduced legacy classification before the exact contract was added.
An isolated client build then passed all 84 focused classifier, policy, scanner and cache-backed
scene tests without disturbing the running client. The immediate post-cutover baseline was 1,205
legacy entries, including 741 ordinary `TRANSPORT` entries; the subsequent Guthix-row removal lowers
only the total floor. Physical crossing remains in the live backlog and is not claimed complete.

## Enakhra temple secret entrances - 2026-09-08

All 16 exterior `Climb-down;Secret entrance` approaches for the four directional Enakhra boulder
objects (11045-11048) now use exact catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership. Vendored game-value
metadata identifies them as the north/east/south/west secret-boulder multilocs, and the local quest
helper uses the east object to enter the temple. Because the resource previously exposed every
entrance without access metadata and no exact partial-quest unlock predicate was found, entry is
conservatively gated on Enakhra's Lament `FINISHED`. The existing interior sand-pile exits remain
unrestricted, so this correction cannot trap a player during the quest.

The fail-first regression reproduced the missing quest requirement, then passed with all 16 exact
approaches engine-owned, foreign geometry rejected, source loss unable to acknowledge travel, and
the directed temple landing required. No boulder-opening quest action was added. Focused policy,
scanner, cache-backed scene and classifier tests pass. The classifier floor is now 1,207 legacy
entries, including 743 ordinary `TRANSPORT` entries. Physical entry from each side remains deferred.

## POH Outside teleport tablets - 2026-09-08

All eight `Teleport to House tablet: Outside` destination rows now publish through the existing
engine-owned item-teleport lifecycle. Item 8013 has the exact inventory action `Outside` and no
equipment action in the captured definition fixture. The policy admits only the eight audited
`POH_HOUSE_LOCATION` varbit-2187 values and their matching exterior landings, with the original
members, consumable, Wilderness-level and duration metadata intact; malformed gates or endpoints
remain unsupported. This is an exterior teleport and does not enter a house or claim any advanced
POH facility.

The fail-first regression reproduced legacy ownership, then passed for all eight exact rows.
Consumption retains NavigationEngine ownership while the final tablet disappears, a different
house exterior cannot acknowledge the route, and only the directed exterior landing clears it.
The action-definition fixture, focused item policy/scanner, classifier and bank-planning tests pass;
two selected Outside edges withdraw two tablets. The classifier floor is now 1,223 legacy entries,
including 49 item-teleport rows and 759 ordinary `TRANSPORT` entries. Physical and forced-bank
acceptance for this exact action remains deferred.

## Runecrafting altar exit portals - 2026-09-08

All 16 remaining `Use;Portal` Rune Temple exit rows now use exact catalogue/NavigationEngine
ownership. Vendored game-value metadata identifies IDs 34749-34754, 34756, 34757 and 43478 as
the Mind, Water, Earth, Fire, Body, Cosmic, Nature, Chaos and Blood temple exit portals. Every row
is item-, fare-, dialogue-, skill-, quest- and var-state-free. A frozen directed manifest is used
rather than enabling generic `Use;Portal`; this is essential for Chaos ID 34757, whose three
origins have three distinct surface landings. Runtime resolution requires the exact object ID near
the recorded origin, and the pending interaction remains owned until its selected surface landing.

The fail-first regression reproduced legacy ownership before the manifest was installed, then
passed with all 16 rows engine-owned, foreign geometry rejected, source disappearance rejected,
and another Chaos exit's landing unable to acknowledge the selected route. Focused classifier,
policy, scanner and cache-backed scene tests pass. The classifier baseline is now 1,231 legacy
entries, including 759 ordinary `TRANSPORT` entries. Physical altar-exit acceptance remains
deferred; no gameplay input was issued.

## Meiyerditch course traversals - 2026-09-08

Sixty-six exact Meiyerditch/Ver Sinhaza rows now use NavigationEngine ownership: 18 floorboard
jumps, six walk-across floors, 20 rubble/crawl-wall/rock/shelf/washing-line links, seven
prepared-floor climbs, five tunnel/barricade rows, and ten post-quest access rows. The first 56
require 26 Agility and Darkness of Hallowvale `IN_PROGRESS`; prepared floors additionally require
`MYQ3_WALL_FLOORBOARDS_DOWN` varbit 2589 to equal 1. The final ten require Darkness of Hallowvale
`FINISHED`: six Ver Sinhaza castle entrance/exit approaches, two reusable push-wall directions,
and two western-wall climbs. Only the western-wall climbs are normalized to the agility feature
switch in that post-quest slice; doors and the push wall are ordinary access transitions.

Strict directed geometry, exact object identity and exact destination acknowledgement prevent a
nearby course object, intermediate tile, failed obstacle or disappearing object from advancing the
route. The earlier claim that fourteen special rows still needed ownership is superseded. Local
quest evidence shows that the knife is used only for the one-time push-wall setup and that the
western-wall IDs here are not the modern rope-built Darkmeyer shortcut, so neither a recurring
knife nor a level-86/rope gate is imposed. Quest-time floor knockdown, initial push-wall setup,
barricade discovery/search flow and other quest solving remain separate; this is traversal after
the required persistent or quest state, not whole-course or quest completion. Fail-first
regressions reproduced missing gates/legacy ownership before the exact policies were added. The
current classifier baseline is 1,247 legacy entries, including 775 ordinary `TRANSPORT` entries.
Physical course-chain acceptance remains deferred.

## Abyss exit rifts - 2026-09-08

Eleven exact inner-Abyss `Exit-through` rows now publish as catalogue/NavigationEngine-owned
transitions: Air, Mind, Water, Earth, Fire, Body, Cosmic, Chaos, Nature, Death and Blood. The
directed manifest preserves the existing Lost City, Mourning's End Part II and Sins of the Father
completion gates, rejects foreign geometry and retains the route edge until its altar landing.
The [Abyss](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Abyss) confirms that these rifts directly access
their runic altars without talismans or tiaras and documents the restricted destinations.

Law and Soul deliberately remain legacy-owned. Law additionally enforces Entrana prohibited-
equipment restrictions, which the plain catalogue row does not encode; Soul requires using dark
essence rather than the row's unrestricted `Exit-through` contract. The test-first regression
reproduced legacy ownership for the deterministic set before the manifest was added. Compilation,
435 focused navigation/transport/toggle/benchmark tests, both Checkstyle tasks and the whitespace
check passed. Current classifier baseline is 1,292 legacy entries, including 820 ordinary
TRANSPORT. Physical acceptance remains deferred and Phase 6 remains open.

## Audited agility traversal batch - 2026-09-08

Twenty-eight ordinary transport rows now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership: eight Nature
Grotto bridge jumps (3522), fourteen Agility Pyramid entrance-rock climbs (11948/11949), two
Rellekka Hunter-area handholds (19846/19847), and four God Wars Dungeon/Wilderness handhold rows
(26405). One 26405 row is an exact catalogue duplicate, so the frozen directed manifest contains
27 unique route keys while all 28 loaded rows are covered. Exact object/name/action matching and
exact destination acknowledgement prevent another nearby lane, movement near the far end, or
object disappearance from retiring an unfinished crossing.

The resource now records 1 Agility for the Nature Grotto bridge, 30 Agility for the second
Agility Pyramid rock set, 35 Agility for the Rellekka handholds, and 60 Agility plus Troll
Stronghold IN_PROGRESS for the GWD handholds. The first Pyramid rock set remains level-free.
All four families are normalized as agility shortcuts for configuration filtering. The GWD route
is one-way and exposed to the area's chill effect; this batch adds no hazard protection or quest
solver. The local generic shortcut table's level-1 Rellekka entry conflicts with the current wiki,
so the conservative current level-35 requirement is used and recorded for live verification.

Pre-change regressions reproduced legacy ownership and premature near-destination clearance.
Compilation, 433 focused navigation/transport/toggle/benchmark tests and both Checkstyle tasks
passed. Current classifier baseline is 1,303 legacy entries, including 831 ordinary TRANSPORT.
Physical acceptance remains deferred; no gameplay input was issued and Phase 6 remains open.

## Fremennik surface rope bridges - 2026-09-07

Ten exact surface crossings (21306-21315) now use catalogue ownership, strict directional
object identity and exact destination acknowledgement. The mine shortcut's two ordinary rows
now require 40 Agility and honour the agility toggle; its stale Cross-bridge action is corrected
to Walk-across. Other surface bridges are not newly gated behind quest completion or repair:
the quest walkthrough documents travel around the islands before repair. No repair inputs are added.

The five underground bridge rows (21316-21319) remain pending encounter/access review; one bridge
is the Ice Troll King boundary and must not be treated as another unrestricted surface crossing.
Three pre-change regressions reproduced legacy ownership, missing skill metadata and premature
near-end acknowledgement. Physical acceptance remains deferred; no gameplay input was issued.
Sources: [mine bridge](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rope_bridge_(Neitiznot)) and
[Fremennik Isles walkthrough](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Fremennik_Isles), corroborated
by the local quest helper's bridge-repair and boss-entry steps.

Validation: compilation, 423 focused tests, both checkstyle tasks and diff whitespace checks
passed. Current classifier baseline is 1,331 legacy entries, including 859 ordinary TRANSPORT.

## Isafdar logs and tripwires - 2026-09-07

Fourteen exact ordinary crossings (six log balances and eight tripwires) now use catalogue
ownership. Strict object identity and exact destination confirmation prevent near-end movement
or object disappearance from acknowledging arrival. The six logs now require 45 Agility and
Regicide IN_PROGRESS or later, and respect the agility-shortcut toggle despite being ordinary rows.
Sources: [Tirannwn logs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Log_balance_(Tirannwn)) and
[tripwires](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Tripwire).

The four [leaf-pit rows](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Leaves_(trap)) remain legacy/pending
implementation: failure drops the player into a pit and requires a verified climb-out protocol.
This batch does not implement poison treatment or claim safe travel through Isafdar's hazards.
Live crossing/failure checks remain in the acceptance backlog; no gameplay input was issued.
Pre-change tests reproduced unsupported ownership and premature near-landing clearance.
Compilation, 419 focused tests, and both checkstyle tasks passed. Classifier baseline:
1,341 legacy entries, including 869 ordinary TRANSPORT entries. Phase 6 remains open.

## Short agility crossings and Revenant duplicate cleanup - 2026-09-07

Four one-tile typed agility rows (Varrock trellis 2149 and Shaman Caves jagged wall 2926)
now use catalogue ownership with exact landing, strict object identity and unchanged level/quest
gates. The generic catalogue distance check previously rejected them, while adjacent actions did
not support Climb/Jump-over. Missing objects cannot acknowledge a failed crossing.

Removed eight obsolete ordinary Revenant pillar rows, retaining the existing ten typed shortcuts.
This eliminates six missing-skill variants and ordinary-row bypasses of the agility toggle; two
obsolete rows also disagreed with the canonical object's ID/endpoint. Pre-change tests reproduced
the ownership gap and presence of ordinary Revenant variants. See the agility coverage document
for sources and live gates. Counts: 1,355 legacy, including 883 ordinary TRANSPORT.

The eight Champions' Guild stepping-stone rows are deliberately not migrated: the wiki reports
a change from four stones to one, so the old intermediate endpoints need runtime verification
and replacement. No Hub changes, live input or commit were made.
Validation: compileJava, 415 transport/navigation/toggle/benchmark tests, both Checkstyle tasks
and git diff --check passed. The first full run required updating the existing typed-agility
inventory expectation from 248 to 252 catalogue-owned rows (14 to 10 legacy rows).

## Agility scope expansion and Tarn jumps - 2026-09-07

The user requests all shortcuts and course obstacles. [walker-agility-coverage.md](walker-agility-coverage.md)
tracks missing route data as well as legacy ownership, including 74 local rooftop ObjectSteps with
no matching transport TSV object IDs. Their object coordinates are not assumed to be landing tiles.

All 46 exact Tarn pillar/ledge routes now classify as catalogue transitions. A frozen directed
manifest and strict ID lookup prevent same-name substitution. Headless reproduction showed the
generic two-tile tolerance could accept neighbouring tiles; Tarn now requires its exact destination.
Tests cover all 46 rows, foreign geometry, a 5x5 landing neighbourhood, missing objects and falls.
This does not disarm log traps or claim safe whole-dungeon navigation. Physical testing is deferred.

Classifier counts: 1,365 total legacy / 889 ordinary TRANSPORT. No gameplay input or commit.
Validation: compilation, 409 focused transport/navigation/benchmark tests and both Checkstyle
tasks passed. The first full run exposed an older pillar-count assertion; it now accounts for
35 Tarn pillars plus two already-migrated Revenant pillars, retaining six legacy Revenant rows.

## Meiyerditch floorboards and Ranging Guild requirement - 2026-09-07

All 18 directed Jump-to Floorboards rows now use catalogue/NavigationEngine ownership through
an exact endpoint, plane, object-ID and action manifest. The resolver permits a five-tile lookup
for this family, covering the far side of the three-tile jumps, but requires the exact object ID:
nearby same-named floorboards cannot substitute a different jump. Existing directed landing
confirmation and pending-edge retirement remain the execution protocol; no additional jump loop.

Headless regression covers all 18 rows, foreign geometry/action rejection, origin/mid-jump and
lower-plane failed positions, persistent objects, disappearance and actual destination arrival.
The wiki's [course walkthrough](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Darkness_of_Hallowvale/Quick_guide)
describes direct jumps separately from wall pushing, keys and ladder repair. Those quest/setup
interactions are not included, nor is whole-course access or hazard handling claimed complete.

The two Ranging Guild entry rows now require 40 Ranged; the two exit rows remain unrestricted.
This fixes missing resource metadata, not guild-door execution ownership. The pre-change tests
reproduced both zero-level entry metadata and legacy floorboard classification. Ice Gate, hot vent
and Wintertodt access protocols remain pending implementation, not just live verification.

Classifier baseline: 1,411 legacy rows, including 935 ordinary TRANSPORT rows (18 fewer).
Validation: compileJava, all 407 focused transport/navigation/benchmark tests, both Checkstyle
tasks and git diff --check passed. Existing compiler deprecation warnings remain unrelated.
Live object positions/actions, bidirectional jumps and failed-jump recovery remain deferred in
the live backlog. No client restart, gameplay input or commit was performed.

## Ardougne wall doors - post-Biohazard headless cutover, 2026-09-07

The 01:16:49 BST log selected LEGACY_LOCKED for `2559,3299,0 -> 2556,3299,0`,
`Open;Ardougne Wall Door;8738`. All four exact three-tile approaches (8738/8739)
now use adjacent engine ownership and retain the wide-gate actual-boundary retirement guard.
Tests cover east/west crossing, near-side positions, persistent/opened doors and quest metadata.
There is no broadening to arbitrary three-tile doors.

The resource lacked access requirements. All four rows now require Biohazard FINISHED,
following the specific [wall-door page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ardougne_Wall_Door).
The broader [West Ardougne page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/West_Ardougne) instead
mentions Plague City completion. This conflict is unresolved: the implemented gate is deliberately
the conservative post-Biohazard contract, not a verified earliest-unlock claim. Earlier access
must be verified before relaxing it; no quest actions or alternate wall-entry protocol were added.

Physical Open/cross, current/transformed IDs and no inverse bounce remain live checks. No
client input or restart occurred. Legacy classifier totals are 1,429, including 953 ordinary
TRANSPORT rows, four fewer than the preceding checkpoint.

Validation: compilation, 90 focused gate/navigation/classification/benchmark tests and both
Checkstyle tasks passed. Initial failures were the two expected classifier-count changes;
updated totals passed the rerun. Live acceptance remains deferred and nothing was committed.

## Stronghold and colony wide gates - headless cutover, 2026-09-07

The 00:40:35 BST runtime log selected LEGACY_LOCKED for `2462,3382,0 -> 2461,3385,0`,
`Open;Gate;190`. All six exact Stronghold approaches and four Swan Song-gated Piscatoris
Colony gate approaches (12723/12725) now classify as adjacent engine-owned crossings.
No generic widening of Open/Gate eligibility was made; foreign geometry and missing colony
quest requirements remain unsupported. Resource requirements and coordinates are unchanged.

Stronghold's diagonal approaches require crossing the north/south boundary, not just lateral
alignment with the destination. Both the pending scanner and engine retirement protect the
directed boundary: nearby raw-route progress cannot retire these wide gates before crossing.
An opened object's disappearance still permits engine-owned forward movement. This addresses
a newly exposed migration hazard, not a proven diagnosis of the user's legacy in/out loop.

Only the normal direct gate protocol is implemented. First-entry Femi dialogue, Grand Tree
restricted-entry/smuggling and its optional fare remain unimplemented special protocols;
do not claim full quest-state coverage. [Femi](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Femi)
documents those branches. [Colony gate](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Colony_gate)
corroborates both Open object identities. Live crossing and inverse-bounce checks remain
deferred in the ledger. Classifier totals: 1,433 legacy rows, including 957 ordinary TRANSPORT.

Validation: compileJava, 470 focused transport/navigation/banking/requirement/cost/collision
and benchmark tests, both Checkstyle tasks and diff whitespace checks passed. Initial focused
tests identified only the expected ten-row classifier-count changes; those totals were updated.
No restart, live movement or commit was performed. The legacy gate loop itself remains a
live reproduction/acceptance item, not a claimed headless fix.

## Broken Raft and desert gate requirements - 2026-09-06

User runtime evidence showed repeated `You need a mithril grapple tipped bolt with a rope`
while the selected route used `Grapple;Broken Raft;17068`. The two catalog rows had only
skill gates. Routing now additionally requires finished grapple 9419 in the ammo slot and
a compatible crossbow equipped, with the same check immediately before legacy object dispatch.
Inventory/bank possession is not equipment preparation. No new barehanded route is enabled:
the wiki's newer level-48 variant does not prove that the currently issued Grapple action works.
Automatic equipment preparation/banked grapple setup and equipment-free interaction verification
remain implementation work. Equipment readiness participates in the transport memo key.

Al Kharid's four paid rows retain the 10-coin requirement but are rejected after Prince Ali
Rescue completion, when Pay-toll disappears; the existing free quest-gated Open rows remain.
Shantay Pass's six ticket rows (including Unkah) are consumable, so repeated entrances sum
ticket quantities or their purchasable fare fallback. Desert Elite varbit 4486=1 removes
entry ticket/fare requirements and suppresses vendor purchases without mutating shared rows;
the exemption also participates in memo invalidation. Return directions remain free.

These are requirement fixes, not new traversal ownership. Shantay and the equipped raft still
require migration. Rebuilt-client live verification is deferred; see the live-testing backlog.

Validation: compileJava, 100 focused requirement/banking/route/benchmark tests, both Checkstyle
tasks and diff whitespace checks passed. No client restart, gameplay input or commit.

## Yanille pick-lock door - headless cutover, 2026-09-06

The two directed `Pick-lock;Door;11728` rows at `2601,9481/9482,0` now use
`ADJACENT_TRANSPORT`. Exact geometry/action/ID, 82 Thieving, reusable inventory lockpick
`1523`, duration and requirement metadata delimit this migration. The bank planner retains
one lockpick across repeated crossings; a strange old lockpick is not a substitute.
[Yanille Agility Dungeon](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Yanille_Agility_Dungeon) and
[Lockpick](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lockpick) document these requirements.

A failed pick leaving the door present does not retire the edge. An opened/disappeared door
uses existing engine-owned forward crossing, while actual directed arrival retires the edge.
The scene requires the exact ID and rechecks boosted Thieving and carried lockpick on the
client thread. Losing either requirement is unavailable, not missing-object clearance;
existing bounded interaction acknowledgement/recovery remains with NavigationEngine.
[Thieving](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Thieving#Picking_doors) documents that failed
picking can lower Thieving. No new retry loop or legacy movement owner was introduced.

The two Ardougne Pick-lock rows (11719/11720) remain pending exact location/requirement
verification; this is not broad Pick-lock support. Physical success/failure, transformed
door identity, skill drain and bank-only setup remain in the live ledger. No client input
or restart was performed. Resource classifier totals are now 1,443 legacy rows, including
967 ordinary TRANSPORT rows (two fewer in each count).

Validation: `:client:compileJava`, 463 focused walker/navigation/banking/transport and
pathfinder benchmark/requirement/cost/collision tests, both Checkstyle tasks and `git diff --check`
passed. The initial focused run exposed only the two intentionally changed classifier totals;
those expectations were updated from 1,445/969 to 1,443/967 before the successful suite.
Existing deprecation warnings remain. Live acceptance is deferred.

## Draynor basement unlocked crossings - headless cutover, 2026-09-06

The 18 directed `Open;Door` rows for IDs `137..145` now classify as `ADJACENT_TRANSPORT`.
This migrates **crossing already-unlocked doors only**, not lever solving or the whole puzzle.
The exact endpoint/object/display/duration/varbit contracts are frozen; existing resource gates
remain unchanged. Exhaustive tests compare all 64 A-F lever combinations for every row against
the existing solver's door masks. Missing gate metadata and foreign geometry remain unsupported.

The two-tile links reuse adjacent-door clearance and engine-owned forward crossing, rather than
remote-transition waiting that would strand a player beside a door that merely opened. Persistent
objects retire on the directed destination side, not at the source or middle tile. Scene lookup
requires the exact puzzle-door ID and rechecks lever values on the client thread. Pending observation
distinguishes loss of eligibility from disappearance of an opened object: a relocked door becomes
`UNAVAILABLE`; a player already across it may still retire the edge. Other adjacent families retain
their existing observation behaviour through the scene interface's default enabled verdict.

The existing `Rs2Walker.processWalk -> DraynorBasementSolver.solveIfNeeded` preparation remains
unchanged and is still legacy orchestration. No new lever pulls, quest actions or nested walk loop
are added by this slice. [The quest guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Ernest_the_Chicken)
also notes that leaving/re-entering resets levers; future physical acceptance must include refreshed
locked states, door opening/crossing in both directions and no inverse bounce. These gates are in the
live ledger and are not satisfied by the headless truth table.

At this historical checkpoint, the classifier changed from **1,463 to 1,445** legacy rows and
**987 to 969** ordinary TRANSPORT rows, while full puzzle ownership and Phase 6 closure remained
open. The 2026-09-15 closure entry at the top supersedes that implementation status; no client
restart or gameplay input was performed for this earlier slice.

Validation passed: compilation, **459** focused transport/banking/navigation/core tests including
the pathfinder benchmark, main/test Checkstyle and `git diff --check`. The initial fail-first
resource test rejected the 18 crossings as expected; classifier count assertions were updated
only after the corpus reported the exact 18-row reduction.

## Harmony monastery doors - headless requirement correction, 2026-09-06

Both `3804,2844,0 <-> 3806,2844,0 | Open;Door;22119` rows previously lacked access gates.
A fail-first resource test reproduced zero conditions. They now require `3393>4`, matching
`BRAIN_BARREL_SETUP >= 5`: the bundled `TheGreatBrainRobbery.setupConditions` identifies that
state as `churchDoorGone`, after placing the keg, attaching the fuse and lighting it. Values zero
through four must not publish these crossings; both directions retain the destroyed-door gate.
No explosives or quest items are added to bank planning, and the walker does not demolish the door.

This is **not an interaction migration or complete Harmony safety implementation**. Object `22119`
is the entrance wrapper; definitions `22113..22118` name its barred, barrel/fuse and collapsed states.
The [quest walkthrough](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Great_Brain_Robbery) and bundled quest
helper show later entry into the Barrelchest instance. The [island guide](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Harmony_Island)
also confirms that gas requires equipped underwater protection during the quest and disappears only
after completion. A destroyed door therefore proves neither gas safety nor a normal non-instance
landing. Do not add a generic `Open` exception or infer that carrying protective equipment is enough.

Both rows remain legacy-owned; counts stay **1,463** legacy rows / **987** ordinary TRANSPORT rows.
Outstanding work: inspect transformed actions and collision after demolition and after quest
completion, establish the safe post-quest crossing protocol, and separately model any intentionally
supported in-progress equipment/instance flow. These are implementation gates, not merely deferred
live acceptance. No client restart, gameplay input, quest progression or combat occurred.

Validation passed: compilation, 77 focused tests including the new fail-first gate regression,
the Waterfall/Zanaris regressions, classifier and pathfinder benchmark, plus both Checkstyle tasks
and `git diff --check`. The legacy counts are unchanged; no new crossing is claimed complete.

## Waterfall internal doors - headless cutover, 2026-09-06

All four `Open;Door;2002` rows now require reusable key `298`. The fail-first resource test
reproduced empty item requirements; the shared bank planner now requests one key across both
doors and repeated return crossings, not one key per use. The [key documentation](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Key_(Waterfall_Dungeon))
confirms both western doors require it, including returning through the corridor, and that a steel
key ring cannot substitute. The walker does not search crates or collect replacement keys.

The 38-tile links are not rewritten as adjacent doors. Bundled quest helpers corroborate the
separate throne-room copy: `WaterfallQuest.setupZones` records both west and east end rooms;
`RovingElves.setupZones/setupSteps` and `SongOfTheElves.setupSteps` identify door `2002` at
`2566,9901,0` and the post-quest room around `2604,9901,0`. Their ordinary door steps require the
key without an item-target icon or additional dialogue. Those two exact directed links now use
the existing `CATALOG_TRANSITION` lifecycle, restricted to `Waterfall Quest=FINISHED` so this
cutover does not promise the same landing through unfinished quest puzzle states. The two adjacent
`2568,9893,0 <-> 2568,9894,0` rows keep their existing adjacent ownership and gain the missing key gate.

The remote scene resolver requires exact object ID `2002`, not another nearby generic Door.
No new executor, dialogue selection, puzzle solving or walking loop is introduced. Source-object
disappearance and an intermediate coordinate cannot acknowledge success; the directed room landing
does. Headless checks cover both directions, resource gates, bank aggregation, missing/wrong keys,
unfinished quest metadata and foreign geometry. Classifier counts fall from **1,465 to 1,463**
legacy rows, including **989 to 987** ordinary TRANSPORT rows.

Validation passed: compilation, **454** selected transport/banking/navigation/requirement/core
tests including `PathfinderBenchmarkTest`, both Checkstyle tasks and `git diff --check`.

Rebuilt-client definition/action checks, key-in-bank withdrawal and physical crossings in both
directions remain in the [live ledger](walker-live-testing-backlog.md). No restart, gameplay input
or live acceptance was performed for this batch. Pre-completion chamber routing remains separate
implementation work; the original geometry concern below records the earlier investigation checkpoint.

## Zanaris shed - headless cutover, 2026-09-06

The old `3202,3169,0 -> 2452,4473,0 | Open;Door;2406` row had no access requirement.
A fail-first resource regression reproduced one unrestricted row instead of the expected access
variants. It is replaced by three exact, post-`Lost City=FINISHED` contracts: Dramen staff `772`
with elite diary varbit `4498=0`; Lunar staff `9084` with the same diary predicate plus 65 Magic /
40 Defence; and item-free entry at `4498=1`. Staffs are reusable bank-planned requirements, not
consumables. This conservatively excludes completing Lost City via the door; quest progression
is outside this transport migration. The staff remains equipped; original-weapon restoration is
not included in this entrance contract.

The [shed transcript](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Door_(Lumbridge_Swamp)) confirms that the
door never visually opens and that an easy clue can add a two-option menu. The existing catalog
lifecycle now owns inventory-tab opening, staff equipment observation, exact door `Open`, optional
`Let it transport you to Zanaris.` selection, and directed landing. Only the full, unique menu
paired with `Just enter the shed.` is accepted; partial/duplicate/foreign options and Continue
pages receive no input. Pending observation carries the prior stage so a closed destination menu
cannot regress to another door click before landing. Exact object ID resolution prevents another
nearby ordinary Door from inheriting this contract.

The [Lunar staff requirements](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Lunar_staff) are encoded on its
own variant rather than imposing its wield levels on Dramen users or offering an unusable banked
staff to a lower-level account. Existing resource filtering, configuration and banking own
availability; no planner interaction or legacy control loop was added. Initial classifier failures
showed the intended one-edge reduction: **1,466 -> 1,465** legacy rows and **990 -> 989** ordinary
legacy rows (one former route becomes three supported access variants).

Compilation, 450 selected transport/banking/navigation/requirement/core tests including the
pathfinder benchmark, and main/test Checkstyle passed. Headless coverage includes exclusive diary
states, Lunar levels, reusable staff quantities, strict menu matching, hidden inventory, equipment
acknowledgement, no-input transit and directed landing. Physical acceptance and loading the new
bytecode into a restarted client are deferred per the user's headless-first request. No character,
inventory, config or live-client changes were made for this batch.

The next Waterfall investigation confirms [key 298](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Key_(Waterfall_Dungeon))
is required for the western locked doors and cannot be stored on a steel key ring. That does not
establish which physical doorway the two object-2002 38-tile links represent. Their geometry,
key/item-on-object protocol and applicability of any correction to the adjacent rows remain
unverified; those long links stay legacy-owned and no speculative landing/key rewrite was made.
See the live ledger for the separate implementation and acceptance queues.

## Equipment-gated ladders and audited direct doors - 2026-09-06

Ten previously legacy-classified resource rows now publish `CATALOG_TRANSITION`:
four Shadow Dungeon ladder approaches (`6560`), the Waterfall entrance/exit (`2010`/`2000`),
Baba Yaga's house exit (`16774`), and three Dorgesh-Kaan entrance approaches (`6919`).
Exact directed manifests retain the completed Desert Treasure I, Waterfall Quest and Death to
the Dorgeshuun prerequisites. Unrelated routes sharing these object IDs remain unsupported.

Shadow Dungeon preparation is observed before looking for its invisible ladder: open inventory,
wear one supported visibility ring, observe equipment, then resolve and climb the transformed ladder.
NavigationEngine owns every stage and acknowledges completion only at the directed landing.
The ring remains worn for dungeon visibility; repeated route uses require one reusable banked ring.
The completed-Waterfall-Quest entrance no longer incorrectly requires Glarial's amulet, consistent
with the [documented dungeon requirements](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Waterfall_Dungeon).
This does not add pre-completion quest access or solve a quest.

Focused classification, scene, scanner, banking and NavigationEngine regressions pass, together
with compilation and main/test Checkstyle. The loaded corpus has **1,466** legacy edges, including
**990** ordinary `TRANSPORT` edges. Every loaded ladder row is now engine-classified, subject to its
existing access gates; classification is not a claim of universal live acceptance.

The rebuilt logged-in client repeated the read-only resource/definition probe at **20:00:04 BST**:
the same 15 audited rows changed from `catalogOwned=0` before the patch to `catalogOwned=10`.
Wrapper `6560` uses visibility varbit `15152` and transforms to ladder `6561`, whose action is
`Climb-down`; all three ring alternatives expose `Wear`. No relevant errors appeared in the probe
log window. Probe: `%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/gated-entrances-20260906/GatedEntrancesProbePlugin.java`.
The probe was undeployed after verification and did not move the character.

Physical acceptance of these ten rows remains deferred. Zanaris's clue-dependent dialogue, the two
38-tile Waterfall door links and puzzle doors are deliberately outside this cutover. Phase 6 remains
active; no legacy orchestration was deleted.

## Dwarven Mine trapdoor verification - 2026-09-06

The reported northern Dwarven Mine trapdoor was tested on the running client without changing
production code. Both resource approaches for object `11867` already classify as
`CATALOG_TRANSITION`. A read-only client-thread probe confirmed that the live object at
`3019,3450,0` exposes only `Climb-down`; return ladder `17387` exposes only `Climb-up`.
This particular trapdoor has no observed `Open` or `Close` stage.

- At **18:29:44-18:29:50 BST**, the walk from `3018,3452,0` to `3018,9850,0`
  issued one engine-owned `Climb-down` and completed with HTTP `ARRIVED`, distance zero.
- At **18:30:05-18:30:12 BST**, the return issued one engine-owned `Climb-up`, resumed
  ordinary movement, and completed at `3018,3452,0` with HTTP `ARRIVED`, distance zero.

Neither crossing emitted legacy ownership or recovery. The approach also opened the building's
ordinary door under NavigationEngine. An initially chosen staging tile `3019,3453,0` was rejected
as unwalkable at radius zero; the confirmed walkable `3018,3452,0` was used instead. A later
attempt to prepare a closed trapdoor via the Agent Server's `Close` interaction descended instead;
it is excluded from acceptance and does not establish a walker failure or a closed-state protocol.
The character was returned to the surface. The reported legacy fallback has not been reproduced;
capture the complete failing route's `nav_mode ... unsupported=` entry before widening eligibility.

Regressions pin both trapdoor approaches, directed underground acknowledgement, and the complete
loaded ladder corpus: at that checkpoint only the four ring-gated Shadow Dungeon ladder rows remained
legacy-classified (subsequently migrated in the equipment-gated batch above).
Two zero-length ladder resource rows are excluded by the loader, not executable legacy edges.
These checks do not claim that every ladder or specialised door is live-accepted.

Read-only probe: `%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/dwarven-trapdoor-20260906/DwarvenTrapdoorProbePlugin.java`.

## Handover snapshot - 2026-08-05

This workspace contains the uncommitted incremental migration; preserve the dirty worktree and do
not reset unrelated or earlier phase changes.

**Branch move (2026-08-05):** the uncommitted walker changeset was moved by stash from
`WalkerRewrite` onto `Fix-The-Walker`, a fresh branch from the 1.12.35 release. Work committed
only on `WalkerRewrite` did not come along; the pieces the walker changeset depended on were
re-applied here by hand: the `Rs2PathApi` facade swaps in `Script`, `QuestScript`, `Rs2Bank`,
`Rs2DepositBox`, `Rs2LeaguesTransport`, `Rs2NpcManager`, and `Rs2Slayer`; a stale
`setPathfinderFuture` line in the lifecycle runtime; a regenerated client-thread guardrail
baseline (lambda indices shift whenever `Rs2Walker` gains lambdas); and a direct-capture fallback
in `Rs2DoorGeometry.wallOrientations` so an empty client-thread hop cannot read as "no blocking
orientation". The `Rs2Dialogue` caching/content-gating layer (phantom-dialogue fixes,
`invalidateDialogueState`) remains only in `WalkerRewrite` commits — cherry-pick it from there if
that behavior is wanted on this branch. The full client unit suite passes on this branch.

**Current position:** Phase 6 is active. Phases 0, 1, 2, and 4 are complete. Phase 3's unified
ordinary executor is live and accepted, but its final legacy deletion/default-cutover gate remains.
Phase 5 mineables and ordinary doors/gates have completed headless and live acceptance, while their
legacy deletion gate intentionally waits for the remaining route families. Phase 6 families already
accepted in both directions are adjacent same-plane shortcuts, stairs/ladders/trapdoors/caves,
simple item teleport, direct NPC/ship travel plus gangplanks, paid coin-only charter ships, and
free dialogue-menu NPC/ship/boat travel (`NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT`, object and NPC actors both
live-proven) including its coin-paid step 2 (Port Sarim/Musa Point and Ardougne/Brimhaven
ferries live-accepted both ways; `CONFIRM` stage headless-proven, no post-Sailing coin row
prompts live). Captain Shanks' ticket-purchase conversation and Port Khazard voyage are also
live-accepted; the corrected Port Sarim option is headless-proven. Directed three-letter non-POH
fairy rings are now live-accepted in both directions,
including displaced-weapon restoration proven by equipment state. POH/DIQ fairy-ring edges remain
legacy-owned for the later POH slice. Non-POH spirit trees are also live-accepted in both directions,
including session filtering and replanning for grey locked destinations. Gnome gliders are now
live-accepted in both directions, including the three Stronghold descents and its two-tile
`Open;Tree Door` boundary after the reverse landing. Quetzals are also live-accepted in both
directions, including varbit-gated exclusion of a grey locked destination. The POH physical portal
foundation is live-accepted in both directions; configured high-level POH facilities remain deferred
until an equipped house is available. Seasonal transports now have a headless cutover: all 169
packaged Clue compass and Map of Alacrity rows have explicit executors and publish as engine-owned
remote teleport interactions, while unknown row shapes are rejected before routing. Live acceptance
is deferred until the relevant League server/items are available. Banked-transport route setup is
now headless- and live-complete: one explicit coordinator owns the bank leg, bank transaction,
final replan, and target leg while the navigation engine continues to own each walk. The remaining
Phase 6 work is the audited unsupported/specialised-family backlog below. All ten exact Guardians
of the Rift barrier rows are now engine-owned and rebuilt-client accepted in both directions, with
the completed-quest and player-participation varbit gates encoded directionally. The two adjacent
Temple of the Eye portal rows are also exact-contract engine-owned and live-complete in both
directions on rebuilt post-cutover bytecode. The two Hazeel Cult raft rows are exact-contract
engine-owned headlessly, preserving legacy's direct `Board` behaviour while retaining directed
landing validation for incorrect sewer-valve states. All 16 Port Phasmatys Energy Barrier rows
are exact-contract engine-owned headlessly: paid pre-quest rows require two ecto-tokens and an
equipped ghostspeak item, while completed-quest rows use the modern free `Pass` action. The paid
west-to-east barrier contract is also rebuilt-client accepted with banked requirements; this is
representative acceptance, not a claim that every quest-state/direction row was run live. All seven teleportation
lever rows are now headless- and live-complete behind an engine-owned staged interaction: rebuilt-
client acceptance passed for both the Wilderness-warning and direct-return directions without a
legacy ownership marker. All 25 River Lum canoe rows now have a dedicated engine-owned staged
interaction. Ferox Enclave/Edgeville acceptance passed in both directions; the one-way Wilderness
Pond warning remains headless-proven rather than live-claimed. All 47 packaged minecart source rows
(254 directed transports after loader expansion) now publish through a dedicated engine-owned
interaction. The Grand Exchange/Keldagrim free pair passed rebuilt-client acceptance in both
directions; paid Ice Mountain/White Wolf and Kourend destination-menu travel, plus train-cart
weapon/shield restoration, remain headless-complete rather than live-claimed. Eighty-eight
deterministic generic teleportation-portal rows now publish as engine-owned, with the representative
Edgeville/Soul Wars pair live-accepted in both directions. Twelve Castle Wars Guthix rows remain
legacy-owned because identical object inputs declare two possible directed landings. Phase 7 has not
started. All 20 active grouping-tab minigame rows now publish through one staged engine interaction;
the direct-activity path is representative-live-complete, while the three Rat Pits destination-option
rows remain headless-complete rather than live-claimed. The commented broken Keldagrim Rat Pits row
is not an active catalog row. All 12 packaged Magic Mushtree source rows now expand to 24 directed
runtime edges and publish through one staged engine interaction. The Mushroom Meadow/Verdant Valley
pair is representative-live-complete; undiscovered menu destinations are rejected without input,
session-disabled, and replanned without surrendering movement ownership.
All 12 magic-carpet rows are headless- and representative-live-complete, including the observed
200-coin fare and the bounded 60-second flight lifecycle. Hot-air balloons are headless- and
representative-live-complete: 51 resource rows expand to 225 directed engine-owned edges with
destination-log banking, and an empty-equipment Entrana-to-Taverley run consumed one normal log,
retained engine ownership through both interface stages, and arrived normally. Wilderness
obelisks remain deliberately legacy-locked: the
audit proves 270 genuine remote rows share random `Activate` inputs, plus 48 unsafe self-pad loader
artifacts; this account has not completed Wilderness Hard and no deterministic live probe was made.
The deterministic axe- and machete-gated chopping subset is now headless-complete. Seventy-six
unique `Chop-down;Jungle Bush/Jungle tree` Kharazi inputs and all ten paired
`Chop-down;Vines` Brimhaven Dungeon rows publish as `JUNGLE_OBSTACLE`; the 16 Kharazi rows
belonging to eight inputs that each declare two directed destinations remain legacy-locked. All
102 rows retain bank planning for one reusable machete or axe alternative. Representative live
acceptance remains deferred because these crossings are in hazardous jungle/dungeon areas and no
character movement was attempted.
All 25 canonical Neypotzli `Pass-through;Entrance` rows now reuse the direct catalog-transition
lifecycle. Every row requires `Perilous Moons=IN_PROGRESS`; two older surface rows with a stale
`(1440,9509,1)` landing were removed in favour of the later canonical `(1439,9509,1)` approaches.
The exact route manifest prevents unrelated Entrance objects from inheriting ownership. This slice
is headless-complete and live-deferred because the account must first gain access during the quest.
All 21 exact `Climb-up;Rope` rows are now engine-owned catalog transitions. Twenty newly migrated
routes join the previously supported route; the four Saradomin God Wars rows are available only
after their permanent ropes are installed, using varbits 3967 and 3968. A rebuilt-client probe
confirmed all 21 classify correctly while the uninstalled God Wars routes remain unavailable.
All 18 exact `Climb-down;Hole` rows are now engine-owned as well. The three Royal Trouble cave
rows require its action-bearing quest stage (`2141>119`), and the 15 God Wars entrance rows require
the permanently installed rope (`3966=1`). On the rebuilt client both varbits were zero and all 18
routes were correctly filtered from pathfinder availability.
All 16 exact Chasm of Fire `Enter;Lift` rows now share the direct catalog-transition lifecycle;
actual lift use remains live-deferred because every landing is inside the demon-filled dungeon.
All ten directed Fremennik basalt-causeway rows now share that lifecycle and are live-accepted in
both directions. Internal jump failure recovery is pinned by the observed wash-back geometry and a
deterministic engine regression; the rebuilt follow-up runs did not randomly fail, so that recovery
branch remains live-in-passing rather than claimed from a post-fix failure trace.
All 20 generated Shilo Village `Pay-fare;Travel cart` rows now reuse the paid dialogue-transport
lifecycle for their exact direct object action and remote landing; rebuilt-client object-definition
evidence confirms both catalog IDs expose `Travel cart` with `Board` and `Pay-fare`. Live travel
remains deferred until the account is logged in at a safe cart endpoint.
All five exact Fossil Island `Jump on;Rubber cap mushroom;30606` rows now reuse the direct
catalog-transition lifecycle. Their five distinct origins declare one directed remote landing and
carry no item, fare, quest, or var-state requirement. Exact-ID/action/name policy and production
corpus tests reduce the ordinary legacy count by five without admitting neighboring mushrooms or
other jump actions. A read-only probe against the rebuilt client confirmed `rows=1327 groups=260`
for the remaining ordinary legacy inventory and was undeployed afterward. Live acceptance remains
deferred because the account remained at the login screen and no character movement was attempted.
All ten exact Myths' Guild `Pass;Magical Barrier` rows for object IDs 31616 and 31617 now reuse the
same direct catalog-transition lifecycle. The six bridge rows for ID 31616 were corrected to require
`Dragon Slayer II`, matching the four dungeon rows and preventing an inaccessible route from being
offered before guild access. Exact identity, quest-gating, classifier, regression, benchmark, and
Checkstyle coverage pass. A read-only probe against the rebuilt client confirmed
`rows=1317 groups=259` and was undeployed afterward. Live crossing remains deferred because the
account remained at the login screen and no character movement was attempted.
All 32 exact Prifddinas `Enter/Exit;City Gate` rows for object IDs 36518, 36519, 36522, and 36523
now reuse that lifecycle as two direction-specific contracts. Every row already carries the
`Song of the Elves` completion gate; `Enter` admits only IDs 36518/36519 and `Exit` only IDs
36522/36523, so swapped actions and neighboring gates remain legacy-locked. Exact identity,
quest-gating, classifier, regression, benchmark, and Checkstyle coverage pass. A read-only probe
against the rebuilt client confirmed `rows=1285 groups=257` and was undeployed afterward. Live
crossing remains deferred because the account remained at the login screen and no character
movement was attempted.
All 53 exact `Enter;Passageway` rows now reuse the direct catalog-transition lifecycle: 52 Tarn's
Lair room transitions and the Rogues' Den lobby exit to the Toad and Chicken. OSRS Wiki MCP evidence
identifies both families as single-action passageways, while cache metadata pins the Tarn production
IDs to `lotr_ruins_door` variants and ID 7258 to `roguesden_passage_to_pub`. Tarn's trapped pillar,
ledge, and floorboard obstacles remain legacy-owned. Exact identity, classifier, regression,
benchmark, and Checkstyle coverage pass. Read-only probes against rebuilt clients confirmed the
intermediate `rows=1233 groups=257` Tarn-only result and final `rows=1232 groups=256` complete-family
result; both probes were undeployed afterward. Live passage remains deferred because Tarn's Lair is
hazardous, the account remained at the login screen, and no character movement was attempted.

The 42-row `Enter;Tunnel` family has been split by exact object protocol rather than migrated by
display name. The three object-ID 2141 rows are the quest-free, one-way Fremennik Slayer Dungeon
exit; OSRS Wiki MCP documents `Enter` as its sole action and the dungeon entrance as its landing, so
those rows now use the direct catalog-transition lifecycle. The other 39 rows remain legacy-owned:
the Stronghold Slayer Cave pair needs 72 Agility, the Miscellania pair needs 40 Agility and Royal
Trouble, the Kalphite/Lumbridge cave links have light-source or access-state hazards, the Ancient
Pyramid back door is quest-unlocked, and the Troll Romance tunnel groups are not requirement-complete
in the transport resource. Exact-ID policy and resource regressions keep those contracts separated.
The broad regression, benchmark, and Checkstyle suite passes, and a read-only probe against the
rebuilt client confirmed `rows=1229 groups=256` with 39 `Enter;Tunnel` rows still legacy-owned; the
probe was undeployed afterward. Live crossing of ID 2141 remains deferred until the account is
safely positioned inside the dungeon.

The 43-row `Jump-to;Pillar` family is also split by exact location and requirement shape. OSRS Wiki
MCP identifies the Revenant Caves pillars as direct `Jump-to` shortcuts with easy/medium/hard
requirements of 65/75/89 Agility; failure deals 4-11 damage but still crosses. Only the two directed
easy-shortcut rows at `(3220,10088,0) <-> (3220,10084,0)` carry their documented 65 Agility gate,
so those exact object-ID 31561 rows now use `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. Six medium/hard Revenant rows lack
their documented skill requirements and remain legacy-owned, as do all 35 Tarn's Lair pillar rows:
Tarn's hanging-log trap can knock the player off and deal 15-20 damage. The policy is pinned to the
exact easy-shortcut coordinates and object identity, and the resource regression asserts the 2/41
ownership split. The broad regression, benchmark, and Checkstyle suite passes, and a read-only probe
against the rebuilt client confirmed `rows=1227 groups=256`, 41 remaining pillar rows, and 39
remaining tunnel rows; the probe was undeployed afterward. No live crossing is planned while the
account is at the login screen; Revenant Caves are PvP Wilderness and are not an appropriate
unattended acceptance location.

**Remaining `Open;Door` audit (2026-09-02):** all 29 remaining rows stay legacy-owned; an
`Open` action alone does not prove a direct scene-transition lifecycle. OSRS Wiki MCP object
metadata and location guidance separate this family as follows:

| Rows | Object / location | Outstanding requirement or interaction evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 18 | IDs 137-145, Draynor basement | Lever puzzle and varbit-gated doors need explicit non-blocking puzzle ownership. |
| 1 | ID 16774, Baba Yaga house exit | Exact action and landing need live confirmation. |
| 1 | ID 2000, Waterfall dungeon exit | Exact action and landing need live confirmation; do not infer entrance requirements for an exit. |
| 1 | ID 2010, Waterfall entrance | Amulet requirement changes after quest completion; current static requirements need a separate audit. |
| 2 | ID 2002, long Waterfall internal links | Key requirement and 38-tile catalog span need investigation; the two already-migrated adjacent rows are outside this count. |
| 1 | ID 2406, Zanaris shed | Equipped staff, quest/diary state, and clue-dependent dialogue prevent a generic direct transition. |
| 3 | ID 6919, Dorgesh-Kaan entry | Missing quest gate corrected; physical crossing remains unaccepted. |
| 2 | ID 22119, Harmony monastery | Quest-stage explosive-door and gas/gear state need explicit handling. |

[Dorgesh-Kaan](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dorgesh-Kaan) requires completion of
`Death to the Dorgeshuun`. A read-only probe on an account without that completion reproduced
`PathfinderConfig.useTransport` returning `usable=true gated=false` for all three ID 6919 rows.
The resource rows now require that quest to be `FINISHED`, and a fail-first regression pins both
the requirement and continued legacy ownership. This fixes route eligibility, not interaction
ownership: ordinary legacy rows remain **1,227** across **256** groups, and the generated total
legacy floor remains **1,875**. Phase 6 is still open.

Rebuilt-client verification at **2026-09-02 22:19:34 BST** repeated the unchanged read-only
probe with `canTestDorgesh=false`: origins `(3318,9602,0)`, `(3317,9602,0)`, and `(3317,9603,0)`
all reported `usable=false gated=true`, and the legacy door count remained `29`. No movement or
physical crossing was attempted. Compilation, all **247** selected route-classification,
transport, core, and pathfinder-benchmark tests, and main/test Checkstyle passed. The temporary
probe was undeployed after verification; the successful negative eligibility check does not close
these doors' live crossing gate.

**`Enter;Hole` audit (2026-09-02):** the 27-row family splits into 12 Crandor entrances,
12 Catacombs of Kourend entrances, one Corsair Cove Dungeon entrance, and two Piscatoris links.
The Catacombs and Corsair rows now reuse the existing engine-owned `CATALOG_TRANSITION` lifecycle,
pinned to `Enter;Hole` and object IDs `28915`, `28919`, `28920`, `28921`, and `31791`.
All 13 inputs have deterministic directed destinations and no item/fare requirements; unlock
conditions still filter the enabled graph before classification. Unknown hole IDs stay legacy-owned.

The audit also reproduced **eight incorrect unlock conditions** in the live resource catalog.
At **22:51:05 BST**, the read-only client probe reported `unlockRows=12 mismatches=8`.
Live object definitions prove `28919` uses varbit `5088`, `28920` uses `5089`, and `28921`
uses `5090`; all three transform to the common `Hole/Enter` object `28915` only at value `1`.
Two base-object rows incorrectly referenced `5080` (Slayer helmet unlock) and `5070` (Monkey
Madness II counter), while six transformed-object rows incorrectly reused the Shayzien unlock.
The resource now applies the location-specific condition to all four approach rows per entrance:

| Entrance | Directed landing | Unlock |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shayzien | `(1650,9987,0)` | `5088=1` |
| Dark Altar | `(1719,10101,0)` | `5089=1` |
| Lovakengj | `(1617,10101,0)` | `5090=1` |

The fail-first regression checks all 12 rows and independently enables each location to ensure
one unlock cannot admit another entrance. A separate classification regression pins the **13/14**
engine/legacy split and rejects ambiguous directed inputs. The 12 Crandor rows remain legacy-owned
because [Dragon Slayer I entry can trigger a cutscene](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_Slayer_I/Quick_guide);
the two Piscatoris rows still need exact interaction evidence. The
[Catacombs holes](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hole_(Catacombs_of_Kourend)) unlock by climbing
their respective vines from below, whereas the [Corsair entrance](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Hole_(Corsair_Cove_Dungeon))
is a direct descent into the eastern dungeon. Physical crossing acceptance remains deferred;
the Catacombs entrances can land beside dangerous monsters and no character movement was used
for this metadata audit.

Rebuilt-client verification at **2026-09-02 23:00:54 BST** repeated the unchanged probe and
reported `rows=27 supported=13 legacy=14` and `unlockRows=12 mismatches=0`. Compilation,
all **250** selected navigation/transport/core/benchmark tests, and main/test Checkstyle passed.
The existing ordinary-legacy count regression now confirms **1,214** rows (13 fewer); the
generated total legacy floor is **1,862**. No new relevant log errors appeared, and the probe
was undeployed after verification. This is runtime metadata/classification proof, not live
crossing acceptance; Phase 6 remains open.

**Catacombs exit-vine slice (2026-09-03):** all 20 exact `Climb-up;Vine` rows now reuse
`CATALOG_TRANSITION`, restricted to IDs `28895`, `28896`, `28897`, `28898`, and `42350`.
They provide four approach rows for each of five destinations: Lovakengj, Shayzien, Dark Altar,
Forthos Dungeon, and Giants' Den. The already-supported central `Vine ladder` is outside this
20-row count. The input audit found no ambiguous directed destinations or item/fare requirements.

The [vine lifecycle](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Vine_ladder_(Catacombs_of_Kourend)) is
asymmetric: climbing out creates the corresponding entrance unlock, so an exit must not require
that unlock beforehand. A read-only production probe at **2026-09-03 00:19:20 BST** reproduced
`rows=20 supported=0 firstUseBlocked=4` and `usable=16 total=20`. All five live object definitions
exposed `Vine/Climb-up`, with no transform or varbit gate. Four older exit rows incorrectly carried
conditions `5090=1`, `5080=1`, `5070=1`, and `5087=1`; those conditions have been removed rather
than copied from the incoming holes. The incoming holes retain their independent unlock gates.
The original Shayzien row's object-ID discrepancy is not changed by this slice; the existing
bounded exact-name/action fallback remains in place pending scene-level identity verification.

Regressions pin all 20 exit rows' empty prerequisites, five directed destinations, exact policy
identities, and retained incoming-hole locks. Physical crossing and first-use unlock creation remain
live-deferred: the probe reads metadata and eligibility only, without moving into dangerous areas.

Rebuilt-client verification at **2026-09-03 00:27:23 BST** repeated the unchanged probe:
`rows=20 supported=20 firstUseBlocked=0` and `usable=20 total=20`. Compilation, all **253**
selected navigation/transport/core/benchmark tests, and main/test Checkstyle passed; the first
validation attempt could not clean stale resource outputs, and retrying after stopping the client
resolved that build issue without deleting worktree files. No new relevant client-log errors
appeared. The probe was undeployed, the client remained logged in, and no physical crossing was
attempted. The ordinary-legacy regression now confirms **1,194** rows; the total legacy floor is
**1,842**. Phase 6 remains open.

**`Climb;Steps` slice (2026-09-03):** the 22-row family has been audited by exact object
identity and location. Eight rows now reuse the engine-owned `CATALOG_TRANSITION` lifecycle:
four Taverley upper-level links (`30189`/`30190`), one main Waterbirth exit (`8966`), and three
Weiss salt-mine exit approaches (`33261`). All expose `Steps/Climb` in the running client,
have no item/fare requirements, and have one directed destination per complete input. The
pre-change probe at **00:42:39 BST** reported `rows=22 supported=0 legacy=22`.

The remaining 14 rows stay legacy-owned: eight Karuulm links (`34530`/`34531`) pending review of
heat protection/warning behaviour, two Island of Stone links (`37417`) pending exact interaction
evidence, and four two-tile Kurask/Wyvern links (`29993`/`8729`) pending tighter same-plane landing
verification. The current shared scanner's two-tile landing tolerance includes the origin of
those short links; merely treating the name `Steps` as another stair family would acknowledge a
crossing before it happened. The new Steps policy therefore also rejects same-plane endpoints
within that tolerance. This does not fix the shared scanner for previously migrated families;
that is a separate priority follow-up before admitting more short links.

The [Taverley upper-level restriction](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Taverley_Dungeon) is
described as a restriction on killing dragons, not a prerequisite for climbing the steps; no
unproven Slayer-task gate was introduced. Similarly, the Kurask/Wyvern attack restrictions must not
be copied into travel requirements without evidence. [Karuulm's floor](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Karuulm_Slayer_Dungeon)
can rapidly damage players without suitable boots or the diary reward, so those rows are not
included in this direct-action slice. No character movement or crossing was attempted.

Verification: after rebuilding and restarting the client, the unchanged read-only probe at
**00:50:44 BST** reported `rows=22 supported=8 legacy=14`. All nine inspected object definitions
still exposed `Steps/Climb` without transforms. Compilation, **255 focused tests** (including the
pathfinder benchmark), and both main/test Checkstyle checks passed. No new relevant errors appeared
in the bounded client-log check. The probe was undeployed and the client remained logged in.
This verifies runtime classification and metadata, not physical crossing acceptance. The
ordinary-legacy regression now confirms **1,186** rows; the total legacy floor is **1,834**.
Phase 6 remains open, with short-link landing acknowledgement the next priority investigation.

**Shared short-link landing fix (2026-09-03):** the read-only production probe at **01:01:19 BST**
examined all 348 engine-classified same-plane catalogue links of up to four tiles. **177** incorrectly
reported `CLEARED` at their own origin; all 348 accepted their exact destination. A two-tile example
also incorrectly cleared its midpoint. `CatalogTransitionRouteScanner` now requires the destination
side of the directed catalogue vector when endpoint tolerance areas overlap, while retaining the
two-tile tolerance for longer links and plane changes. This changes acknowledgement, not eligibility.

A second isolated-engine probe at **01:06:41 BST** reproduced `interaction-edge-crossed` before the
three-tile destination was reached, even when the pending observation remained `AVAILABLE`.
`NavigationEngine` now retains catalogue interactions until landing is explicitly `CLEARED`, rather
than retiring them from nearest-raw-index progress alone. Both missing-source and persistent-source
paths have regression coverage. The scanner's three fail-first regressions and the engine's
fail-first retirement test reproduced their respective conditions before correction; compilation,
**352** navigation/transport/core/benchmark tests, and both Checkstyle tasks passed afterward.

Rebuilt-client verification at **01:14:08 BST** repeated the unchanged probe:
`shortRows=348 sourceCleared=0 destinationRejected=0`. The two-tile origin and midpoint remain
`AVAILABLE`, while the destination and bounded overshoot are `CLEARED`. The isolated engine now
reports `approach=interaction-command-in-flight` and retires only at landing. No new relevant log
errors appeared; an unrelated world-hopper ping `ConnectException` warning was observed. The probe
was undeployed, and no character movement or physical crossing was attempted. This is runtime
verification of the acknowledgement and ownership predicates, not live acceptance of every family.
Eligibility remained unchanged at 1,834 legacy entries before the following item batch.

**Staged jewellery/cape batch (2026-09-03):** the complete 128-row candidate set was audited
together. The unchanged read-only probe reproduced `rows=128 supported=0 legacy=128 definitions=112`
before cutover and reported `rows=128 supported=99 legacy=29 definitions=112` against the rebuilt
client at **01:41:41 BST**. Ninety-nine rows across 27 item families now publish as `ITEM_TELEPORT`.
One engine-owned lifecycle opens the correct tab, dispatches the exact inventory/equipment
destination, and retains the pending interaction through charge replacement/disappearance until
the directed landing is observed. There is no legacy Rub/dialogue orchestration fallback.

All accepted item alternatives are checked against a committed fixture of 112 public live item
definitions. Exact action aliases cover NPC-named diary cape destinations, Hunter/Strength capes,
Digsite pendant, Slayer ring, and inventory/equipment Ring of shadows differences. All 99 rows
continue to participate in the existing shared banking planner. Compilation, **653** selected
walker/banking/transport/navigation/seasonal/core tests including the pathfinder benchmark, and
both Checkstyle tasks passed. The production-classifier corpus test pins **1,735** legacy entries,
including **119** item rows. See the [batch backlog](walker-transport-batches.md) for the 29 exact
jewellery/cape deferrals; this is not live acceptance of high-level or account-locked destinations.

The client was restarted with `:client:run` (the previously tested `runDebug` waits for debugger
attachment), and the unchanged temporary probe was rerun. The welcome overlay initially blocked
the bank approach. After it was dismissed, the user completed Wintertodt's lossy exit confirmation;
that legacy Doors of Dinh preparation is not an item-executor acceptance trace.

**Representative jewellery acceptance:** one banked Ring of dueling(2) was manually withdrawn.
The initial route selected a minigame teleport, so a temporary setup probe saved the original
item/minigame settings, enabled carried-item teleports, and disabled minigame teleports for the
following tests. These are executor tests, not another banked-coordinator acceptance claim.

- **01:51:15-01:51:21 BST:** `item-use:inventory:Emir's Arena`; item 2564 became 2566 (2 -> 1
  charge), followed by `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived`. The strict HTTP destination-radius
  check returned `success=false` despite `state=ARRIVED` (landing four tiles from the requested
  offset target with radius three); this first request is not claimed as a clean HTTP pass.
- **01:53:43-01:53:48 BST:** `item-use:inventory:Castle Wars`; the final charge removed item
  2566, inventory became empty, landing was `(2438,3091,0)`, and the request returned
  `success=true state=ARRIVED` with no positional-fallback completion. The target was the exact
  catalogue destination `(2440,3090,0)` with radius six to include the observed landing spread.
- **01:54:09-01:54:16 BST:** `item-open:equipment:Emir's Arena` then exactly one
  `item-use:equipment:Emir's Arena`; the already-equipped ring changed 2552 -> 2554 (8 -> 7
  charges). Landing `(3313,3233,0)` returned `success=true state=ARRIVED`, again without positional
  fallback, for catalogue target `(3315,3235,0)` with radius six. No equipment swap was needed.

All three item runs retained NavigationEngine ownership; the bounded item-test log interval had
no legacy markers or new relevant item/navigation errors. Both probes were removed, the setup
probe restored the original route settings, and the character was left idle at Emir's Arena.
Direct-action capes, high-level/account-locked destinations, and the 29 rejected contracts remain
headless/deferred as documented; representative ring acceptance does not make every destination
live-complete. Phase 6 remains open and Phase 7 has not started.

Temporary probe: `%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/phase6-item-batch-20260903/ItemBatchProbePlugin.java`.
Temporary settings/equipment probe: `%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/phase6-item-live-20260903/ItemLiveSetupPlugin.java`.

**Caller-radius and final-endpoint correction (2026-09-03):** the jewellery acceptance's strict
radius mismatch was traced to `Rs2WalkerLifecycleRuntime`, which constructed the immutable engine
request from the sidebar default instead of the explicit `walkWithState` distance. A live short-walk
probe at **03:09:44 BST** reproduced `requested=0 configured=5 captured=5 result=ARRIVED remaining=4`.
Destination setup now carries the explicit radius across asynchronous planning; same-destination
replans and cave-route comparison retain it. Cached-route reuse requires an active request with the
same destination and radius. Default-only callers still use the configured radius for fresh requests.

After rebuild and dismissal of the welcome overlay, the unchanged probe at **03:16:42 BST** reported
`requested=0 configured=5 captured=0 result=ARRIVED remaining=0`. A radius-zero HTTP return walk also
returned `success=true state=ARRIVED distanceToDestination=0`, without positional fallback. An earlier
post-restart attempt correctly captured zero but exhausted input acknowledgement while the welcome
overlay was still visible; it is not counted as acceptance.

The subsequent radius-zero Castle Wars teleport test exposed a second previously hidden failure:
nearest-raw progress already pointed to the final index after an off-centre landing, causing
`ROUTE_EXHAUSTED` replans and repeated selection of the same charged teleport. That bounded failed
run issued **four** teleport inputs and consumed **four charges** (equipped ring 2554 -> 2562,
7 -> 3 charges), before ending `UNREACHABLE` one tile away. Test overrides were immediately removed;
no further charged travel was attempted in this correction.

`NavigationEngine` now approaches its existing raw endpoint without a replan when that endpoint
satisfies the caller's radius, is on the same plane, and is within normal click reach. This exact
final approach prefers canvas input; normal acknowledgement/recovery limits remain intact. A partial
endpoint outside the goal radius still replans. The regression first failed with
`expected CLICK_TILE but was REQUEST_REPLAN`, then passed after correction.

A non-consuming live probe simulated only the completed teleport in an isolated engine and exercised
the real ground-click adapter. Before correction it reported `first=REQUEST_REPLAN issued=false
remaining=1`; after the final rebuild at **03:24:40 BST** it reported `selection=route-end-approach
first=CLICK_TILE issued=true remaining=0 result=COMPLETE`. This verifies the actual final ground
input without claiming a second full charged-teleport run. **659** selected regressions, the
pathfinder benchmark, compilation, and both Checkstyle tasks passed. No new relevant errors appeared
in the final bounded log check. Probes were removed, settings restored, and the character left idle
at `(2440,3090,0)` with the three-charge ring still equipped. No files were staged or committed.
Ownership counts remain **1,735** legacy entries / **119** item entries; Phase 6 remains open.

Temporary probes:
`%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/phase6-radius-20260903/RadiusProbePlugin.java` and
`%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/phase6-radius-end-20260903/RadiusEndProbePlugin.java`.

**Second staged-item batch (2026-09-03):** all 64 remaining other-item candidates were reviewed
together against the live client definitions. **44 rows across 16 families** now use the existing
`ITEM_TELEPORT` scanner/scene and NavigationEngine lifecycle: diary cloak/gloves/legs/blessing,
memoirs and Book of the dead, lyres, teleport crystals, selected medallion/sceptre destinations,
GE/Yanille tablets, and basalts. Inventory-only items explicitly return no equipment action.
The action fixture now contains **166** public item definitions; every accepted alternative is
checked for an exact inventory action and, where supported, an exact equipment action.
All 143 migrated item rows still participate in shared bank planning.

Three fail-first regressions demonstrated absent ownership, missing action aliases, and missing
basalt quest requirements. The patch reuses the existing executor and adds no movement owner.
Ardougne cloak/legs have distinct worn actions; lyres require the client's `Jatiszo` spelling.
Stony basalt now selects `Troll Stronghold entrance` or `Troll Stronghold roof` from the
directed coordinate, never its toggle-dependent default. Both stony rows and the icy row now
require Making Friends with My Arm; the roof retains its existing Agility/diary gates.
These requirements and explicit actions were cross-checked with the
[stony basalt](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Stony_basalt) and
[icy basalt](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Icy_basalt) wiki pages through the wiki MCP.

The rebuilt-client, unchanged metadata probe at **13:57:13 BST** reported
`rows=218 supported=143 legacy=75 definitions=166`, versus `supported=99 legacy=119`
before the patch. All 166 definitions matched the test fixture, with zero mismatches.
Compilation, **663** walker/banking/transport/seasonal/shortest-path regressions including
PathfinderBenchmarkTest, and both Checkstyle tasks passed. No new relevant errors appeared in
the rebuilt-client output. This is runtime classification/metadata verification, **not physical
live acceptance of the 44 added routes**. Available memoirs had no charges/page unlock, and
the inspected Grand Exchange tablet destination was locked, so neither was used.

The remaining 20 other-item rows are 14 Quetzal whistles; two consumable rows containing inert
IDs (Calcified moth and Mokhaiotl waystone); and Ardougne Farm, Chronicle, Slepe, and Jaltevas.
Those four need daily-use, planner-owned charge-input, Slepey-tablet unlock, or obelisk-attunement
work respectively. Keeping them legacy-owned does not validate their existing prerequisites.
Master Scroll Book (18), POH tablets (8), and the prior jewellery/cape deferrals (29) remain.
Current whole-catalogue ownership: **1,691 legacy rows**, including **75 item rows**.
Phase 6 remains open; no Phase 7 or legacy orchestration deletion is authorized by these counts.

Temporary probe:
`%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/phase6-item-other-20260903/ItemOtherProbePlugin.java`.
It was undeployed. No route settings, inventory items, charges or movement inputs were changed
by the test; only the bank was opened/read/closed before restart and the welcome screen dismissed
after configured login. The reported position changed across restart and was moving at final
cleanup, so no idle/safe-position assertion or further in-game action was made. No files committed.

**Follow-up prerequisite audit (2026-09-03):** the 14 whistle rows remain deferred: their map
is interface 949, not Renu's map, and saved setting varbit 19681 can redirect `Signal` straight
to Hunter Guild. Numeric mode semantics and per-whistle charges still require controlled
acceptance. All six destination-build gates are already encoded. The detailed checklist is in
[walker-transport-batches.md](walker-transport-batches.md#quetzal-whistle-audit-and-consumable-prerequisite-corrections-2026-09-03).

The review also reproduced a real bank-planning data bug: two calcified-moth uses requested
only one item because `Consumable=Y` is not recognized by `Transport`. Corrected that field
to `T`, the moth Wilderness ceiling from 29 to 20, and removed inert item-ID alternatives from
both moth and waystone rows. All three new tests failed first; all **666** selected regressions,
compilation, benchmark and both Checkstyle tasks then passed. The unchanged read-only live probe
confirmed real IDs only and two items for two uses. It was undeployed; no game inputs were sent.
No production Java bytecode changed: the probe re-read built resources without restarting, but
an already-cached active route catalogue still needs its normal reload/restart. No physical
teleport acceptance is claimed. Moth landing/partial-quest semantics remain deferred, and neither
row was migrated by this data fix. Counts remain **1,691 legacy / 75 item legacy / 143 migrated
item rows**. No Phase 6 gate was marked complete by this audit.

**Config bypass and Fossil Island rowboat correction (2026-09-03):** the live read-only probe
reproduced `useMagicMushtrees=false` with twelve ordinary rows passing the feature check and
six still published. Dedicated mushtree rows were correctly excluded; ordinary shadow rows
were classified only as `TRANSPORT` by the feature filter. The same flaw affected two ordinary
fairy-ring rows. `PathfinderConfig.isFeatureEnabled` now resolves those exact identities to their
network feature type before using the existing switches; original route classification stays intact.

The pictured dock rowboat (`30914` at `3723,3805,0`) was also reproduced live: `Travel` opens
`Row to the barge.`, `Row to the barge and travel to the Digsite.`, and `Cancel.`. Its blank display
field incorrectly made it direct-owned. `ships.tsv` now supplies the full Digsite option, reusing
the existing `NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT` lifecycle with no new movement or dialogue owner.

Three regressions failed first (both shadow families and the missing option); all **670** selected
regressions, compilation, PathfinderBenchmarkTest, and both Checkstyle tasks passed after the fix.
The switch tests cover all **22 boolean family switches**, each enabled and disabled, plus all
twelve ordinary mushtree and both ordinary fairy-ring rows. The client was rebuilt and restarted
with `:client:run` (`runDebug` suspends awaiting a debugger); configured login succeeded.

The unchanged probe then reported:
```text
live.useMagicMushtrees=false
rowboat.direct=false dialogue=true option=Row to the barge and travel to the Digsite.
feature.allowed ordinary=0 dedicated=0 published=0
```
Both normal live walks passed without config overrides or item use:

- **14:40:56–14:41:01 BST**, dock -> `(3362,3445,0)`: one `Travel` actor input, the exact Digsite
  option, one `dialogue-continue`, then `navigation-engine:arrived`; HTTP `ARRIVED`, distance zero.
- **14:41:39–14:41:44 BST**, Digsite -> `(3724,3807,0)`: direct Barge guard `Quick-Travel`, one
  exact endpoint ground step, then `navigation-engine:arrived`; HTTP `ARRIVED`, distance zero.

No legacy movement ownership was used in either trace. The post-walk probe still reported zero
published mushtree routes, including after cached refresh. No new relevant walker/pathfinder/
dialogue errors appeared in the rebuilt-client log. Settings were unchanged; the character was
left idle at `(3724,3807,0)` and the probe was undeployed. Counts remain **1,691 legacy / 75 item
legacy / 143 migrated item rows**; this corrects an existing route's protocol, not Phase 6 closure.

Probe: `%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/walker-config-dialogue-20260903/WalkerConfigDialogueProbePlugin.java`.
Trace: `%TEMP%/walker-config-client-20260903.out.log`. No files were staged or committed.

**Fossil Island rowboat unlock gate (2026-09-03):** the camp menu was live-reproduced with only
barge, barge-and-Digsite, and Cancel, while both camp-to-north and camp-to-sea BOAT rows were
`allowed=true published=true`. The [rowboat wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Rowboat_(Fossil_Island))
confirms these destinations require discovery trips. No verified unlock varbit was found in the
MCP catalogue. The committed legacy `handleObjectExceptions` has no such guard: it presses the
first character of the numbered display label and waits, which can select a different destination.

The client now observes complete camp menus on ticks, publishes immutable negative availability,
and invalidates transport memo snapshots when that evidence changes. Only the two outgoing camp
BOAT rows are excluded; Digsite and discovery directions remain available. Later menus can restore
destinations, and login-screen reset prevents cross-account carry-over. This remains session-learned
availability, not a pre-arrival varbit gate. Existing pending edges produce `UNAVAILABLE` for the
engine's bounded replan even after their rows disappear from the published catalogue. The six
island BOAT rows use unique destination text rather than fixed menu ordinals in the engine adapter;
the legacy catalogue labels and handler were not rewritten.

Compilation, both Checkstyle tasks, and **330** selected transport/navigation/feature-gate tests
including PathfinderBenchmarkTest passed (zero failures/errors/skips). The new gate API tests
initially failed compilation before implementation; the behavioral failure was established by
the live probe above. Rebuilt client (`:client:run`; `runDebug` awaits debugger attach) replayed
the unchanged probe with the same menu:

```text
camp -> north: BOAT allowed=false published=false
camp -> sea:   BOAT allowed=false published=false
camp -> Digsite: SHIP allowed=true published=true
```

Normal travel still passed: **15:10:28–15:10:35 BST** camp-to-Digsite (`Travel`, exact Digsite
option, continue, engine arrival), and **15:11:23–15:11:28 BST** return (`Quick-Travel`, engine
arrival). Both HTTP results were `ARRIVED`, distance zero. No legacy movement ownership was used.
Unlocked north/sea travel is **headless-only**, not live-accepted. No unlock trip was attempted.
Two startup blocking-event timeouts occurred in WelcomeScreenEvent/BankTutorialEvent during
login transport refresh; no further errors appeared during rowboat verification.

Probe: `%TEMP%/microbot-debug-probes/fossil-rowboat-gate-20260903/FossilRowboatGateProbePlugin.java`.
Trace: `%TEMP%/fossil-rowboat-client-20260903.out.log`. No settings or items changed; character
returned idle to `(3724,3807,0)`. The probe was undeployed and all changes remain uncommitted.
This is a bug fix, not a Phase 6 closure or migration-count change.

**Locked-rowboat recovery follow-up (2026-09-03):** the first true end-to-end locked route exposed
that filtering alone was insufficient. `Travel` was issued at **16:25:05 BST**, but the definitive
missing destination remained behind the generic dialogue-voyage acknowledgement deadline until
**16:26:02 BST**. The rowboat menu therefore sat open for about **57 seconds** before a replan; the
user supplied no input. The replan then walked overland to the north pier and arrived. This was not
acceptable immediate recovery, so the earlier live-acceptance wording above is narrowed accordingly.

A verified complete camp menu that omits the planned destination now produces an engine-owned
`dialogue-cancel-unavailable` stage. After Cancel closes the menu, a distinct unavailable action
supersedes the in-flight Cancel and requests the replan on the next observations rather than after
60 seconds. The generic long voyage timeout is unchanged. The adapter revalidates the exact camp,
menu anchors and missing destination before issuing Cancel, so foreign or changing menus receive no
input. A destination/continue action already in flight suppresses both lock learning and Cancel;
this was required after live testing caught a closing-menu snapshot trying to cancel an available
camp-to-sea voyage after `dialogue-destination:Sea` had already been issued.

All **333** selected transport/navigation/feature-gate tests passed with zero failures/errors/skips,
including the two-stage Cancel/immediate-replan regression and PathfinderBenchmarkTest; compilation
and both Checkstyle tasks passed. The final rebuilt-client return from sea passed cleanly at
**16:43:13–16:43:19 BST**: one `Travel`, `dialogue-destination:Camp`, final endpoint approach and
engine arrival, with no false Cancel or recovery. The camp menu then showed both north and sea, so
this account is now fully unlocked and cannot repeat the locked-menu live gate. Immediate Cancel of
a genuinely locked menu remains captured-live/headless verified, not live-accepted after the fix.
The character was left idle at camp, no items/settings changed, and nothing was committed.

**Cabin Boy Herbert dialogue cutover (2026-09-03):** all ten remaining dedicated `BOAT`/`SHIP`
rows were audited as complete protocols. The four exact Herbert rows now publish as
`NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT`; NavigationEngine owns `Talk-to`, optional Continue frames, the exact
`Can you take me somewhere?` request, the unique `Travel to <destination>.` option, and the
directed landing. Eligibility is restricted to the two packaged NPC IDs/origins, four exact
destinations, zero fare/items/var-state, duration six, and completed `A Kingdom Divided`.

At that point six dedicated rows remained legacy-owned: three Captain Shanks rows, two
variable-dialogue Pirate Pete rows, and Ghost Captain's outbound row whose true ecto-token
requirement can be 25, 10 with Ring of Charos(a), or free after a permanent unlock. The free Ghost
Captain return was already engine-owned. This Herbert cutover reduced the legacy floor from
**1,691 to 1,687** and SHIP legacy rows from seven to three; BOAT remained three.
All **337** selected regressions, compilation, Pathfinder benchmark, and both Checkstyle tasks passed.
A read-only probe against the existing client observed `A Kingdom Divided=NOT_STARTED`, four packaged
Herbert rows and zero active-account published Herbert rows. That verifies the unchanged quest gate
and account prerequisite, not the new executor bytecode; the active client needs a normal restart
to load this patch. Physical Herbert travel remains live-deferred until an eligible account is
available. No gameplay input was issued and the temporary probe was undeployed.

**Captain Shanks dialogue cutover (2026-09-04):** the stale three-row resource contract is now the
two destinations exposed by the live transcript: Khazard Port `(2680,3150,0)` and Port Sarim
`(3050,3192,0)`. Both rows name their destination, require completed `Shilo Village`, and publish
only through the exact Captain Shanks `NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT` policy. The false Entrana-area
`(3047,3235,0)` destination was deleted. Route planning retains a conservative 50-coin maximum;
live dialogue offered a random price in the documented 20-50 range, bought item `621` on site, and
consumed that ship ticket when sailing.

The rebuilt-client run at **16:19:29-16:19:52 BST** issued `Talk-to`, consecutive Continue frames,
the unique affirmative fare option, further Continue frames, `dialogue-destination:Khazard Port`,
and the final sailing Continue without external dialogue input. It paid 42 coins, crossed the
temporary instanced ship scene under the original NavigationEngine interaction, landed exactly at
`(2680,3150,0)`, and cleared as `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` with no recovery or relevant
error. The live run exposed two generic acknowledgement defects: identical consecutive Continue
pages had inherited the 60-second voyage timeout, while shortening every Continue also abandoned
ownership during the real voyage. Visible Continue pages now retry after two seconds; disappearance
promotes the same command to the existing 60-second remote-landing window, and a reappearing page
advances immediately. Arrival Continue cleanup now uses the already-owned edge rather than
re-resolving a post-payment row that may have left the affordable catalogue. The voyage lifecycle is
live-accepted; the final arrival-page cleanup is focused-test complete and awaits its normal rebuilt-
client observation.

**Dedicated boat dialogue closure (2026-09-04, headless):** all 166 generated `BOAT`/`SHIP`
rows now have an explicit engine classification; no dedicated row remains legacy-owned. Pirate
Pete's two quest-finished rows use the wiki-verified `Talk-to` protocol: zero-or-more bounded
Continue pages, the exact unique `Okay!` option, the random post-selection Continue sequence, and
the directed landing. Ghost Captain's outbound row uses `Travel`, equips one carried ghostspeak
alternative (ghostspeak amulet, enchanted ghostspeak amulet, or Morytania legs 2-4), selects the
single affirmative ecto-token payment option, and retains the landing under NavigationEngine.
Its resource row conservatively requires 25 ecto-tokens; the newer 500-token permanent-free unlock
and Ring of Charos(a) discount remain deliberately unoptimised until their persistent state and
live variants are observed. Banking now aggregates currency and reusable-item requirements on the
same edge, so this route requests both the 25-token fare and one wearable instead of silently
choosing one requirement class. Focused dialogue, route-scanner, classifier, requirement-policy,
and banking tests pass. These three rows are not live-accepted because the current account has not
completed `Rum Deal` or `Ghosts Ahoy`; do not mark their live gate complete.

**Mountain Guide shadow-row cutover (2026-09-04, headless):** the six ordinary `TRANSPORT`
duplicates of the already-migrated Mount Quidamortem network now publish through the same
`NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT` lifecycle. Eligibility pins NPC ID `7600`, the six exact directed
origin/destination/display tuples, `Travel`, duration seven, and unlock varbit `5421=1`; it does
not widen generic ordinary-transport eligibility. NavigationEngine owns the actor click, exact
destination selection, and remote landing. The stale resource labels' `1:`/`2:` prefixes are
removed before matching the current three-destination menu documented by the wiki transcript.
This reduces the whole-catalogue legacy floor from **1,671 to 1,665**. Physical acceptance remains
deferred until the account is near the network; the equivalent NPC-table protocol was already
engine-owned, but that is not claimed as live acceptance for these shadow coordinates.

**One-click ordinary NPC transport cutover (2026-09-04, headless):** seven more ordinary
`TRANSPORT` rows now use the existing direct `NPC_TRANSPORT` lifecycle: Brother Tranquility's two
`Transport` directions, Daero's one `Travel` route, Waydar's two `Travel` routes, and Primio's two
`Travel` routes. The wiki NPC definitions expose those actions directly; unlike Mountain Guide and
Dondakan, they do not require destination-menu ownership. Eligibility pins all seven complete
route identities and preserves Primio's completed `Children of the Sun` gate. Exact-ID resolution
remains preferred, with a bounded exact-name/action/origin fallback for transformed Brother
Tranquility variants. NavigationEngine owns the single actor command and directed landing. This
reduces the whole-catalogue legacy floor from **1,665 to 1,658**. Physical acceptance remains
deferred until a rebuilt client is positioned at an eligible endpoint.

**Dondakan equipment/dialogue cutover (2026-09-04, headless):** the single ordinary
`Talk-to;Dondakan the Dwarf` route now publishes as `NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT`. The exact contract
requires completed `Between a Rock...` and one reusable gold helmet (`4567`), so the shared bank
planner can obtain it when available. NavigationEngine owns helmet equipment, the actor click,
arbitrary Continue pages, the exact `Can you shoot me into the rock again?` option, and arrival in
Dondakan's mine. The helmet is deliberately left equipped because it is the mine's traversal gear.
No other ordinary Talk-to row is admitted. This reduces the whole-catalogue legacy floor from
**1,658 to 1,657**. Physical acceptance remains deferred until a rebuilt client is positioned at
the quest-gated endpoint with the required helmet; it is not claimed from headless coverage.

The same runtime audit found a separate set of **45 ordinary `TRANSPORT` candidates** whose action
or actor name looks travel-related: Brother Tranquility (2), Raft (2), Fremennik Boat (7),
Dondakan (1), Mountain Guide (6), Al Kharid toll gates (4), Log raft (2), Waydar (2), Primio (2),
Daero (1), Aged log (2), quick-pass barriers (10), and four Energy Barrier variants. This is an
audit queue, not a dialogue allowlist: several are direct object crossings, while Talk-to and
generic Travel rows require exact per-family option and unlock evidence before migration. The six
Mountain Guide shadows, seven one-click NPC rows, and Dondakan above are now closed, leaving 31
candidates to reconcile against their actual object protocols and existing exact policies; this
number is not a claim that all 31 remain legacy-owned. The final four Energy Barrier variants are
now reconciled below, closing this travel-looking candidate queue.

**Deterministic raft-exit reconciliation (2026-09-04, headless):** the two Waterfall `Board;Log
raft;1987` rows and two Ancient Cavern `Ride;Aged log;25216` rows now reuse the engine-owned
`CATALOG_TRANSITION` lifecycle. Eligibility is pinned to all four complete directed row identities;
NavigationEngine owns the single object command and remote landing. The two Hazeel Cult raft rows
remain legacy-owned because the same `Board` action can return to an intermediate island or fail
according to quest-stage sewer-valve state that the catalogue does not encode. Seven stale ordinary
Fremennik Boat duplicates were removed: the identical canonical `BOAT` rows already use
`NPC_TRANSPORT`, carry the required completed `The Fremennik Exiles` gate, and use the audited
object-backed scene resolver. This reduces the whole-catalogue legacy floor from **1,657 to 1,646**
(four migrations and seven removed unsafe duplicates). Physical acceptance of the raft exits remains
deferred until a rebuilt client can be positioned safely at those endpoints.

**Al Kharid toll-gate cutover (2026-09-04, headless):** all four exact pre-quest
`Pay-toll(10gp);Gate` rows now use the adjacent engine lifecycle. The allowlist pins both lanes,
both directions, object IDs `2786`-`2789`, the ten-coin requirement, and the otherwise empty
requirement shape; it does not admit other paid or adjacent objects. The shared requirement and
banking policies still own coin availability and withdrawal, while NavigationEngine owns the
single gate action and directed one-tile landing. The completed-`Prince Ali Rescue` `Open` rows
remain the already-supported free alternative. This reduces the whole-catalogue legacy floor from
**1,646 to 1,642**. A rebuilt live crossing remains required before claiming physical acceptance.

**Guardians of the Rift barrier cutover (2026-09-04, live accepted):** all ten exact
`Quick-pass;Barrier;43700` rows now use `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The resource rows require completed
`Temple of the Eye`; the five outside-to-inside rows additionally require `GOTR_IS_PLAYING`
varbit `13691` to equal zero, matching the observed outside/player-not-participating state. The five
inside-to-outside rows deliberately remain independent of that state so NavigationEngine can always
own an exit. Eligibility is pinned to object `43700`, the exact action/name, x coordinates
`3613`-`3617`, y coordinates `9482`/`9484`, plane zero, and the directed two-tile geometry. This
reduces the whole-catalogue legacy floor from **1,642 to 1,632**. Focused parsing, ownership, and
negative-contract tests pass. Rebuilt-client acceptance passed in both directions at x `3615`:
outside-to-inside issued one `selection=interaction-catalog_transition stage=Quick-pass` command,
arrived at y `9484`, and changed varbit `13691` from `0` to `1`; inside-to-outside published while
the varbit was `1`, issued the same engine-owned interaction, arrived at y `9482`, and returned the
varbit to `0`. Neither crossing opened dialogue or emitted legacy ownership for the barrier leg.

**Temple of the Eye portal cutover (2026-09-04, live accepted):** the two exact portal
rows connecting `(3104,9573,0)` and `(3615,9470,0)` now use `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. A mixed long-route
probe exposed these rows as the reason the entire request reported `mode=LEGACY_LOCKED`; both fixed
`Enter;Portal` interactions then completed live without dialogue and landed at their declared remote
endpoint. Eligibility is pinned to the complete directed identities, including object `43841` from
the temple and object `43692` from the rift lobby. This reduces the whole-catalogue legacy floor from
**1,632 to 1,630** and prevents this pair from forcing otherwise migrated GOTR routes into legacy
ownership. Rebuilt-client acceptance passed in both directions: `(3615,9470,0)` to
`(3104,9573,0)` issued one `selection=interaction-catalog_transition stage=Enter` command at
23:35:24 and arrived at the exact endpoint at 23:35:26; the reverse issued the same engine-owned
command at 23:35:45 and arrived exactly at 23:35:47. Both requests ended with
`rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` and emitted no legacy ownership marker.

**Hazeel Cult raft cutover (2026-09-04, headless):** both exact `Board;Raft;2849` rows between
`(2567,9680,0)` and `(2606,9692,0)` now reuse `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. This preserves the legacy
contract, which issues the object action and waits for the declared landing; it does not configure
the five Hazeel Cult sewer valves. Correct valve state reaches the directed endpoint, while an
incorrect-island landing cannot acknowledge the edge and therefore replans. Exact origin,
destination, object, action, and name checks reject neighboring raft contracts. Focused policy and
production-corpus tests pass, reducing ordinary legacy rows from **1,135 to 1,133** and the complete
generated legacy floor from **1,630 to 1,628**. Physical acceptance remains deferred until the
account is safely positioned at the quest raft with the valves already configured.

**Port Phasmatys Energy Barrier completion (2026-09-04, headless):** all 16 exact
`Pay-toll(2-Ecto);Energy Barrier;16105` rows now reuse `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The four formerly
ambiguous west-gate rows are mutually exclusive by quest state: duration-two rows describe the
paid pre-`Ghosts Ahoy` landing, while the three-tile quest-gated rows describe the free completed-
quest landing. The shared requirement policy supplies two ecto-tokens and one reusable ghostspeak
alternative before completion, and that same effective requirement feeds path eligibility, cache
invalidation, route analysis, and bank withdrawal. Dispatch equips the ghostspeak item as a
non-blocking preparatory command, then issues the exact barrier action on the same owned edge. On
completed accounts the resolver accepts the modern transformed barrier's `Pass` action while
retaining the catalog identity and directed landing. Repeated-route tests prove two paid crossings
sum to four ecto-tokens but one reusable amulet. Focused policy, banking, classifier, scanner, and
Checkstyle tests pass, reducing ordinary legacy rows from **1,133 to 1,129** and the complete
generated legacy floor from **1,628 to 1,624**. Physical acceptance remains required; no live
Energy Barrier crossing is claimed here.

**External movement and combat recovery correction (2026-09-05, headless):** a live report and
historical `off-route-movement-in-flight` traces exposed that generic moving/animating/interacting
flags could defer recovery until the player stopped. `NavigationEngine` now retains the wait only
when the current movement destination still matches an engine-issued route command. A later manual
click to a divergent destination invalidates that ownership and requests an immediate categorized
replan even after the original command was acknowledged; off-route combat displacement and external
replan requests likewise no longer wait for combat animation or interaction state to clear. Engine-
owned movement and staged transport acknowledgement remain protected. Focused navigation tests,
the navigation shadow corpus, both Checkstyle tasks, and the broader navigation/transport suite
pass after updating the old wait contract. Rebuilt-client live acceptance is still required.

**Charter slice closed (2026-08-05):** reverse Catherby-to-Port-Sarim acceptance passed on
request 2/generation 1. The engine walked from `2809,3441,0` to the charter origin `2792,3414,0`,
issued exactly one NPC-stage and one destination-stage command (this interface presented no
separate `Yes` prompt, so the confirm stage correctly issued nothing), paid the fare (observed as
the inventory-driven transport refresh), landed within tolerance of `3038,3189,1`, chained the
Port Sarim gangplank as one `CATALOG_TRANSITION`, resumed ordinary walking, and arrived. The
whole run stayed on one request/generation with no replan, no recovery, no duplicate charter
input, and no legacy markers. Together with the forward Port Sarim-to-Catherby pass, the paid
coin-only charter family has completed both live acceptance directions.

**Fairy-ring slice closed (2026-08-24):** directed
three-letter non-POH edges publish as `FAIRY_RING`. One pending interaction advances through
optional Dramen/Lunar staff equipment, exact last-destination or configure action, individual dial
rotations, confirmation, remote landing, and original-weapon restoration. The source UI may unload
during travel; only the directed catalog landing acknowledges the teleport. Restoration forces the
inventory tab open as a separate `fairy-ring-restore-open:<id>` stage, waits for the item container,
equips through the normal inventory path, and clears only when
`Rs2Equipment.isWearing(originalWeaponId)` is true. Live acceptance passed from `3129,3496` to
`2705,3576` and back on request generations that emitted both restore stages, resumed ordinary
walking only afterward, and arrived normally. `DIQ` and configured POH-anchor edges stay
legacy-owned until POH migration. Spirit trees and gliders are closed; quetzals are the active family.

**Spirit-tree slice closed (2026-08-25):** directed non-POH
`SPIRIT_TREE` rows are migrated as an object stage (`Travel`), exact adventure-log destination stage,
and directed remote landing. The current destination interface is `947:9`; grey embedded destination
text marks configured-but-locked planted trees, which are not clicked and are removed from both
directions of the session graph before an immediate replan. Grand Exchange/Gnome Stronghold passed
in both directions. Synthesized POH rows remain legacy-owned. Policy, scanner, pathfinder publication,
navigation lifecycle, remote-edge retention, Checkstyle, and thread/query guardrails pass.

**Farmable spirit-tree availability correction (2026-09-03):** a live Catherby-to-Ardougne request
for `2573,3322,0` chartered to Brimhaven and stopped at `2800,3204,0` because the profile explicitly
enabled the Brimhaven player-grown tree even though no `Travel` object existed. The five optional
farmable-tree toggles now default off. A stale opt-in is also detected conservatively within four
tiles of its directed origin, removes both directions from the session graph, and replans instead of
repeating the dead route. With `spiritTreeBrimhaven=false`, the same request live-passed from the
Brimhaven dock: NavigationEngine selected Captain Barnaby's `Ardougne` dialogue transport, crossed
the landing gangplank, retained ordinary movement ownership, and arrived exactly at `2573,3322,0`.

**Transport-cost calibration (2026-08-25):** path search and direct-vs-bank comparison now share
`TransportCostModel` instead of letting reconstructed `path.size()` reduce every transport to one
tick. Successful live traces establish conservative floors of 24 ticks for staged fairy-ring travel
and 12 ticks for spirit-tree menu travel; explicit larger catalog durations still win, and every
other interaction costs at least one tick. Live glider inspection confirmed its existing eight-tick
catalog duration is already conservative, so the shared model records an explicit eight-tick glider
floor. Transport debug output reports both catalog `duration` and effective `routeTicks`. Add a
measured floor for each specialised family as it is migrated. The accepted Quetzacalli
Gorge/Civitas illa Fortis traces establish a ten-tick Quetzal floor from destination selection
through directed landing.

**Gnome-glider slice closed (2026-08-27):** directed `GNOME_GLIDER` rows publish as an NPC
`Glider` stage, exact generated `InterfaceID.Glidermap` destination-button stage, and directed remote
landing. Hidden map buttons are never clicked; the destination is session-disabled in both
directions and the engine replans. Live inspection at White Wolf Mountain verified group `138`, all
seven generated button constants/actions, the `2465,3501,3` Ta Quir Priw landing, and a transformed
Captain Bleemadge actor (`10461` live versus catalog `10459`). The cache-backed resolver therefore
prefers the catalog id but admits a transformed actor only with exact name/action, plane, and origin
proximity. The forward Stronghold-to-Kar-Hewo engine route live-passed with exactly one actor stage,
one destination stage, directed landing, ordinary walking, and arrival. The reverse flight also
landed at the Stronghold top level, but the later plane-zero `Open;Tree Door` edge made the request
`LEGACY_LOCKED`. Those exact distance-two rows now publish through the existing adjacent-transport
state machine without broadening other two-tile doors. The final reverse Kar-Hewo-to-Stronghold run
remained on request 3/generation 1, issued one actor command and one exact `Ta Quir Priw` command,
observed the directed top-floor landing, chained three `Climb-down` catalog transitions, issued one
engine-owned `Open` command for the Tree Door, crossed the cleared edge, and arrived at the plane-zero
target. No `LEGACY_LOCKED`, replan, recovery, or duplicate interaction appeared. The family is closed.

**Quetzal slice closed (2026-08-30):** directed `QUETZAL` rows publish as a live Renu `Travel`
stage, exact `InterfaceID.QuetzalMenu` destination stage, and directed remote landing. The network
catalog intentionally has no stable NPC id, so the cache-backed resolver accepts transforming Renu
definitions only with exact name/action, correct plane, and bounded origin proximity; live ids are
telemetry and may change between observations. Quetzal-whistle item teleports remain legacy-owned.
Live timing raises the catalog's six-tick duration to a ten-tick route-cost floor. Compile,
Checkstyle, policy/scanner, publication, ownership, remote-retention, and
navigation lifecycle tests pass. Forward live acceptance passed from Quetzacalli Gorge to Civitas
illa Fortis on request 2/generation 1: the engine issued exactly one Renu `Travel` command and one
exact `Civitas illa Fortis` destination command, acknowledged the directed landing, and arrived
without duplicate input, replan, recovery, or legacy fallback. The reverse request selected
`Quetzacalli Gorge` exactly once, acknowledged its landing, resumed ordinary walking, and arrived
on request 3/generation 1 with the same clean lifecycle. A third request targeted grey locked Cam
Torum: the transport refresh observed the changed unlock varbit, excluded that Quetzal edge before
interaction, and completed via ordinary walking without issuing any Quetzal command. Both live
directions and locked-destination eligibility are accepted; the family is closed.

**POH physical-portal foundation live-accepted (2026-08-30):** the saved exit-portal tile remains a
logical house-template coordinate while the exact live `POH_EXIT_PORTAL` is resolved globally from
the shared tile-object cache at its loaded instance coordinate. The graph now publishes separate
`TransportType.POH` edges for outside `Portal/Home` and inside `Portal/Enter`; the inside edge belongs
to the outgoing-POH set so it remains present when world-to-POH teleports are intentionally omitted.
Both directions are navigation-owned catalog transitions. With the master `Use POH` toggle enabled,
live Rimmington acceptance issued exactly one `Enter` stage from logical `1859,7052` and landed
outside, then exactly one `Home` stage from `2954,3224` and arrived back at the saved logical tile.
The shared route-cost model applies a conservative six-tick POH floor from these measured loads.
The empty level-48 test house has no portal chamber, nexus, jewellery box, mounted teleports, fairy
ring, or spirit tree, so those configured facility executors remain headless/live-deferred rather
than being claimed complete.

**Seasonal transport slice headless-complete, live-deferred (2026-08-30):** the packaged seasonal
catalog contains 47 Clue compass rows and 122 Map of Alacrity rows. Clue compass destinations reuse
the proven direct inventory/submenu action contract. Map of Alacrity restores the historical
two-stage `187:3` picker contract: select region, then destination, skip `<str>` locked rows, and use
the menu hotkeys for entries below the scroll fold. Both families classify through the existing
engine-owned remote teleport lifecycle and retain their interaction until directed landing. The
transport refresh now requires an explicit registered executor before publishing any seasonal row,
so an unknown or malformed future seasonal definition cannot enter a retry loop. A newly observed
locked Map region/destination is session-disabled and invalidates the transport memo before replan.
All 169 packaged rows, parsing/normalisation/hotkey behavior, engine classification, compile, and
focused unit tests pass. Live acceptance remains intentionally deferred because these items and
interfaces only exist on the corresponding League server.

**Banked-transport setup live-accepted (2026-08-30):** route analysis and
withdrawal planning now share one eligibility predicate, including item-gated ordinary transports
and all registered seasonal item teleports. Originless route extraction uses
`TransportType.isTeleport`, so Clue compass and Map of Alacrity edges are no longer omitted from the
bank plan. Reusable requirements use the maximum needed by any edge; consumables, runes, and fares
sum across uses; and withdrawals subtract the quantity already carried. Pure currency rows remain
currency rows instead of mutating the shared transport catalog. `BankedTransportCoordinator` owns
the explicit `WALK_TO_BANK -> OPEN_BANK -> WITHDRAW_ITEMS -> CLOSE_BANK -> PREPARE_FINAL_ROUTE ->
WALK_TO_TARGET` transaction, aborts before the target leg if a requirement cannot be satisfied, and
delegates both walking legs to the navigation engine. Coordinator, requirement-planning, and compile
checks pass. Live acceptance used a Draynor manor teleport tablet (`19615`) held only in Draynor
Bank, with zero carried. The rebuilt client compared 112 direct ticks with a six-tick banked route,
published one bank-leg item transport, and emitted the complete transaction in order:
`WALK_TO_BANK -> OPEN_BANK -> WITHDRAW_ITEMS` (one tablet, carried zero) `-> CLOSE_BANK ->
PREPARE_FINAL_ROUTE -> WALK_TO_TARGET -> COMPLETE`. The final leg stayed engine-owned, issued one
`interaction-simple_teleport` command for the Draynor Manor tablet, consumed the tablet, observed
the directed landing, and cleared as `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived`; no
`LEGACY_LOCKED` marker or legacy movement handoff appeared.

The live pass exposed and fixed two test-only/production-boundary defects before acceptance.
`TransportCostModel` had queried originless transports through a null key, which works with the
old test `HashMap` but throws for production's `ConcurrentHashMap`; originless costs now read
the transport set published at the route origin, and the regression test uses the production map
shape. Separately, Agent Server's waiting wrapper used to cancel the walker future immediately when
its independent position poll saw the teleport landing. It now gives the owning walker ten seconds
to complete normally before position becomes a bounded fallback, so live automation cannot pre-empt
the coordinator's final acknowledgement.

**Banked-requirement completeness hardening (2026-08-31, headless):** withdrawal planning now
aggregates the complete selected route rather than only transports that fail an isolated one-edge
availability check. Repeated tablets, charged-jewellery uses, spell casts, and fares therefore cannot
all consume the same single carried item/rune stack unnoticed. Inventory accounting uses stack
quantity (not occupied slots), so coins, ecto-tokens, runes, and stacked consumables subtract
correctly. Item IDs encoded for charged jewellery, trimmed/untrimmed capes, and similar variants are
treated as OR alternatives consistently with the pathfinder; a requirement can be fulfilled across
multiple banked charge variants. Reusable capes, tools, fairy-ring staves, and seasonal relics require
one item, while consumables and currencies aggregate conservatively across route uses. Spell planning
aggregates raw rune costs, honors inventory/rune-pouch/already-equipped staff supply, and can select
banked combination runes that cover both elemental requirements. Focused catalog-driven tests cover
Draynor Manor tablets, ring of dueling variants, Crafting capes, repeated Varrock spell casts,
combination runes, coins, ecto-tokens, seasonal rows, and ordinary item-gated transports.

The expansion as a whole remains headless-complete only. The existing live Draynor-tablet trace
still proves the coordinator transaction and engine ownership, but does not by itself live-accept
every newly covered requirement category. A rebuilt-client spot-check additionally proved charged-
jewellery variant selection and withdrawal: a banked Necklace of passage(5), item `21146`, was
withdrawn with none carried and became Necklace of passage(4) after use; a banked Ring of dueling was
also selected and consumed one charge. Both runs emitted the ordered bank-setup phases, withdrawal,
final replan, and arrival. Those destination-submenu item-teleport routes still classified as
`LEGACY_LOCKED`, so this is live evidence for banking coverage and inventory accounting only, not
acceptance of migrated interaction ownership. Withdrawing a banked elemental staff is also
intentionally not enabled yet: that needs an explicit equip, post-teleport restore, and ownership
contract rather than treating a staff as ordinary inventory. Charged-jewellery capacity is not
modeled per item ID yet, so repeated uses conservatively plan one banked jewellery item per edge even
when one high-charge item could cover several uses.

**Banked currency/equipment follow-up live acceptance (2026-09-05):** a rebuilt-client forced-bank
route from Canifis Bank to the paid Port Phasmatys Energy Barrier selected exactly two ecto-tokens
(`4278`) and one ghostspeak amulet (`552`) from the bank with an empty inventory. The coordinator
emitted `WALK_TO_BANK -> OPEN_BANK -> WITHDRAW_ITEMS` (two tokens, then one amulet)
`-> CLOSE_BANK -> PREPARE_FINAL_ROUTE -> WALK_TO_TARGET -> COMPLETE`; the final leg remained
engine-owned, equipped the amulet as an explicit preparation-only action, issued the barrier
`Pay-toll(2-Ecto)` interaction on the following pass, consumed both tokens, and returned `ARRIVED`
at `3655,3485,0` without manual movement or a legacy ownership marker. The controlled run disabled
competing spell teleports, charter ships, and magic carpets, and restored all three settings after
acceptance.

This pass also closed three defects exposed by the first live ecto-token route. Static remote
transport origins already present in a calculated path are now matched directly instead of being
dropped when they cannot be converted through the currently loaded scene. Withdrawal confirmation
now checks inventory quantity rather than occupied slots, so a stack of 27 ecto-tokens confirms as
27 instead of one. Finally, catalog-transition preparation is distinct from issuing the crossing:
equipping a required amulet clears the pending command immediately and lets the engine retry the
actual interaction instead of waiting for the crossing deadline. Focused regressions cover remote
path extraction, stacked-currency confirmation, and immediate retry after preparation.

**Teleportation-lever slice headless- and live-complete (2026-08-31):** all seven packaged
`TELEPORTATION_LEVER` rows now publish through a dedicated engine route/interaction kind. The live
resolver uses only `Microbot.getRs2TileObjectCache()`, requires the exact catalog object id plus
`Lever`/`Pull` identity within two tiles of the directed origin, and never treats disappearance as
arrival. A single pending interaction covers the object click, the optional exact Wilderness warning
continue, the exact `Yes, I'm brave.` confirmation, and the remote teleport. It clears only within
three tiles of the directed catalog destination; source-object or dialogue disappearance keeps the
landing pending under the engine's bounded 30-second remote-interaction deadline. No stage blocks or
sleeps on the client thread. Catalog-count/identity, classification, scanner stages, direct landing,
warning landing, disappearance, wrong-id unavailability, engine ownership, and bounded-timeout tests
pass. The legacy warning handler remains reachable only on a route already locked to the legacy
executor because another unsupported edge exists. Rebuilt-client acceptance passed in both
directions. Request 7/generation 1 used object `1814` at `2561,3311,0`, issued the engine-owned
`Pull`, `lever-warning-continue`, and `lever-warning-confirm` stages, then arrived at
`3154,3924,0`. Request 8/generation 1 used object `1815` at `3153,3923,0`, issued only the
engine-owned `Pull` stage, then arrived at `2562,3311,0`. Neither request emitted a legacy ownership
marker. The controlled test disabled competing item teleports and temporarily allowed Wilderness
routing; the original banked-transport, item-teleport, lever, and Wilderness-avoidance settings were
restored afterward.

**Canoe slice headless-complete and representative-live-complete (2026-08-31):** all 25 packaged
`CANOE` rows now publish through a dedicated engine route/interaction kind. The live resolver uses
only `Microbot.getRs2TileObjectCache()`, requires the exact catalog object id plus `Canoe Station`
identity and a recognized canoe action within three tiles of the directed origin, and never treats
object or interface disappearance as arrival. One pending interaction owns `Chop-down ->
Shape-Canoe -> highest available shape -> Float Canoe -> Paddle Canoe -> exact destination`,
the optional Wilderness warning/confirmation, exact known arrival dialogue, and directed landing.
The scanner keeps a remote edge pending until the catalog destination is reached, under the
engine's bounded 30-second post-destination remote deadline; no stage sleeps or blocks the client
thread. Catalog identity/count, level-to-shape policy, all UI stages, warning and arrival dialogue,
missing-widget/object rejection, classification, ownership, landing retention, and timeout tests
pass. The shared cost model now applies a conservative 54-tick canoe floor from three measured
53-57 tick construction/travel sequences rather than the catalog's 12-tick estimate.

Rebuilt-client acceptance first passed Ferox Enclave to Edgeville on request 3/generation 1 and
Edgeville to Ferox Enclave on request 4/generation 1. Each direction issued exactly one
`Chop-down`, `Shape-Canoe`, `canoe-shape:Waka canoe`, `Float Canoe`, `Paddle Canoe`, and exact
destination command, retained one request/generation through the remote landing, and arrived
without `LEGACY_LOCKED`, replan, recovery, or duplicate input. The canoe travel interface exposed
an independent RuneLite renderer defect: `OverlayRenderer` dereferenced a nullable
`Graphics2D.getClip()` while restoring overlay state, producing per-frame exceptions during both
travel animations even though the walker completed. The comparison is now null-safe. A newly
compiled request 1/generation 1 repeated Ferox-to-Edgeville with the same six engine-owned commands
and normal arrival, with zero new overlay-render exceptions across destination selection and
landing. The ordinary canoe family is live-accepted in both directions. The one-way Wilderness
Pond warning/confirmation remains headless-complete and is not claimed as a live pass because the
controlled account retained its default Wilderness-avoidance safety setting.

**Minecart slice headless-complete and representative-live-complete (2026-08-31):** all 47 packaged
`MINECART` source rows, expanding to 254 directed transports, now publish through dedicated engine
route and interaction kinds. Eligibility is restricted to the exact packaged object/action/name,
currency, and display shapes. The scene resolves only through `Microbot.getRs2TileObjectCache()`;
missing or changed objects and missing menu destinations are unavailable rather than guessed. Grand
Exchange trapdoor travel is a directed one-stage interaction. Keldagrim train carts additionally
stage both occupied hands into inventory, select the exact front cart for the directed row, retain
the interaction through landing, and restore the originally equipped weapon and shield only after
the equipment mirror confirms each item. Kourend minecarts stage the exact object and exact
destination menu entry. No stage sleeps or blocks the client thread. Catalog identity/count,
classification, ownership, staged equipment restoration, direct landing, Kourend menus, changed
object rejection, landing retention, timeout, and conservative cost-floor tests pass.

Rebuilt-client acceptance passed Grand Exchange to Keldagrim and Keldagrim to Grand Exchange. The
forward trace issued `selection=interaction-minecart stage=minecart-object:Travel:-1:-1
action=minecart-interaction issued=true` at `17:11:23`, landed at `2909,10173,0`, and arrived at
`17:11:34`. The reverse route approached the exact front cart at `2923,10171,0`, issued
`selection=interaction-minecart stage=minecart-object:Ride:-1:-1
action=minecart-interaction issued=true` at `17:12:00`, landed at the Grand Exchange, and arrived at
`3141,3504,0` at `17:12:13`. Both runs retained engine ownership with no `LEGACY_LOCKED` or
`processWalk` marker. Paid Ice Mountain/White Wolf and Kourend destination-menu travel remain
headless-complete/live-deferred. Weapon/shield restoration also remains headless-complete/live-
deferred because the controlled account had neither hand occupied during the representative run.

**Generic teleportation-portal slice partially closed (2026-08-31):** the packaged catalog contains
100 rows. Eighty-eight deterministic rows now publish through dedicated engine route and interaction
kinds, restricted to the exact known object id, action, name, display, zero-fare, and no-item shapes.
The live adapter resolves only through `Microbot.getRs2TileObjectCache()`, requires the exact catalog
identity within four tiles of the directed origin, issues one object action, retains ownership while
the source scene unloads, and clears only at the directed landing. Missing or changed objects receive
no guessed input, and the navigation engine supplies the same bounded remote-interaction deadline as
the other migrated teleport families. The shared cost model applies a measured three-tick floor to
one-tick rows while preserving longer configured durations.

The remaining 12 rows were all Castle Wars object `4408`, action `Enter`, name `Guthix Portal`. Six
identical origin/object/action inputs each declare both `2376,9489,0` and `2416,9524,0`; the catalog
therefore cannot promise which directed edge the same click will take. They intentionally remain
`TRANSPORT` / `LEGACY_LOCKED` until the route data or executor can model the team-dependent outcome.
Catalog-count, supported/unsupported classification, exact live identity, source disappearance,
changed identity, directed landing, bounded deadline, route ownership, and cost-floor tests pass.
The 2026-09-08 resolution above supersedes that interim boundary by removing the redundant random
rows while retaining deterministic access to both team rooms.

The pre-cutover Edgeville-to-Soul-Wars baseline emitted
`mode=LEGACY_LOCKED ... rows=TELEPORTATION_PORTAL:Soul Wars Portal:Enter:Soul Wars` and completed
through `rs2walker:processWalk`; the reverse route did the same for the destination-labelled
`Edgeville` action. On the rebuilt client, request 1/generation 1 issued
`selection=interaction-teleportation_portal stage=Enter
action=teleportation-portal-interaction issued=true` at `17:46:57` and arrived at
`2206,2858,0` through `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at `17:47:01`. Request 2/generation 1
issued the corresponding `stage=Edgeville` command at `17:47:24` and arrived at `3081,3475,0` at
`17:47:26`. Neither rebuilt run emitted `LEGACY_LOCKED` or `processWalk`. The original portal,
item-teleport, and banked-transport settings were restored afterward.

**Grouping-tab minigame-teleport slice closed (2026-08-31):** all 20 active packaged
`TELEPORTATION_MINIGAME` rows now publish through dedicated engine route and interaction kinds. The
executor models opening the parent grouping tab, opening the grouping panel and dropdown, waiting
for dynamic dropdown children, selecting the exact activity, teleporting, and (for the three active
Rat Pits rows) selecting the exact destination option. An open dropdown with no children is pending
rather than click-ready, so a slow interface cannot be toggled closed on the next observation.
Activity matching normalizes case, whitespace, and straight/curly apostrophes, including the
catalogue's `Giant's Foundry` versus the live interface's `Giants' Foundry`. The terminal edge is
retained when cooldown varplayer 888 removes the source row and clears only at the directed landing.
The commented `Rat Pits: Keldagrim` line is marked broken in the resource and is not included in the
active count. All 20 active rows, staged widget observations, Rat Pits destination handling, loading
and unavailable states, terminal catalog disappearance, bounded ownership, and route classification
are headless-tested; the Rat Pits destination branch remains live-deferred.

Before cutover, the Ferox-to-Castle-Wars route emitted `mode=LEGACY_LOCKED` for
`TELEPORTATION_MINIGAME` and completed through `rs2walker:processWalk`. On the rebuilt client, the
fully hands-off request 1/generation 1 started at `3151,3635,0` and issued
`minigame-open-grouping-tab` at `19:22:17`, `minigame-open-dropdown` at `19:22:18`, exact
`minigame-select-activity:Castle Wars` at `19:22:19`, and `minigame-teleport` at `19:22:20`.
Cooldown-driven transport refresh then removed the row, but the same engine request retained the
landing and ended through `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at `19:22:38`, one tile from the
catalog coordinate and within the engine's directed landing tolerance. The CLI's stricter
distance-zero wrapper therefore reported `success=false` while its walker state was `ARRIVED`; no
`LEGACY_LOCKED`, `processWalk`, recovery, manual input, or ownership handoff occurred. The isolated
minigame, item-teleport, spell, portal, and banked-transport settings were restored afterward.

**Magic Mushtree slice closed (2026-08-31):** the 12 packaged source rows consist of two origin
tiles at each of four locations plus four destination-only rows; loader expansion produces exactly
24 directed runtime edges. Eligible rows require the exact `MAGIC_MUSHTREE` type, known object ids
`30920`/`30924`, `Magic Mushtree` / `Use` identity, and one of the four catalog destinations. The
cache-backed live adapter resolves the object only through `Microbot.getRs2TileObjectCache()`, opens
the Mycelium Transportation System, normalizes the displayed numeric destination prefix, and
publishes the exact destination as a second immutable stage. A visible menu containing `Not yet
found` instead of the requested destination is unavailable and receives no click. After destination
selection, the engine retains the remote edge across source/interface disappearance and clears only
within six tiles of the directed catalog landing.

The first rebuilt-client attempt from Verdant Valley correctly issued the engine-owned `Use` stage,
then bounded out as `INTERACTION_UNAVAILABLE` because the live menu showed Mushroom Meadow as
`4. Not yet found`; that attempt exposed the need to invalidate unavailable network nodes instead of
only exhausting the edge. After discovering Mushroom Meadow overland, the same widget read
`4. Mushroom Meadow`. The fully hands-off return on request 12/generation 1 then issued
`selection=interaction-magic_mushtree stage=Use` at `20:13:59`, issued the exact
`stage=magic-mushtree-destination:Verdant Valley` at `20:14:00`, and ended through
`rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at the exact `3760,3758,0` target at `20:14:04`. The accepted
request emitted no `LEGACY_LOCKED`, `processWalk`, replan, recovery, duplicate input, or ownership
handoff.

The locked-node follow-up on request 2 proved the hardened path. The already-open group-scoped menu
showed House on the Hill as unavailable, so at `20:49:02` the adapter emitted
`magic_mushtree_unavailable destination=3764,3879,1`, issued no destination click, and requested
generation 2. The invalidation removed both the dedicated `MAGIC_MUSHTREE` rows and their exact
generic `TRANSPORT:Magic Mushtree:Use` shadows into or out of that node. The replacement route used
the known Mushroom Meadow destination at `20:49:03`, then the same navigation engine owned the
overland leg and three catalog transitions before `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at
`20:50:13`, three tiles from the catalog target and inside the engine's landing tolerance. The CLI's
stricter distance-zero wrapper therefore reported `success=false` while its walker state was
`ARRIVED`. No `LEGACY_LOCKED`, `processWalk`, duplicate unavailable-node input, or ownership handoff
occurred. A separate Sticky Swamp fallback correctly remained unsupported because its shortest route
contained the then-unmigrated Rubber cap mushroom shortcut; that historical result was a Phase 6
backlog boundary, not a Magic Mushtree ownership failure. The shortcut has since been migrated as
recorded below. Catalog count/identity, classification, unavailable-menu behavior,
terminal source/menu disappearance, directed landing, broad walker regression, Checkstyle, and the
pathfinder benchmark pass. The original mushtree, item-teleport, spell, ship, and banked-transport
settings were restored.

**Magic-carpet slice headless- and representative-live-complete (2026-08-31):** all 12 packaged
`MAGIC_CARPET` rows now enter the existing engine-owned NPC-dialogue lifecycle only when they retain
the exact `Travel` / `Rug Merchant` / known actor-id / coin-fare shape. A route regression from the
observed Shantay approach proves the three-tick carpet edge beats the approximately 130-tile surface
route. That regression exposed an A* heuristic gap: carpets were absent from the network landmarks,
so a useful rug-merchant origin slightly off the direct walking line was not explored before the
surface goal was reached. Adding carpets to the heuristic-only landmark set changes no graph edge or
interaction ownership. Catalog classification, malformed-row rejection, policy/scanner tests,
compile, and Checkstyle pass. The first rebuilt-client Shantay-to-Bedabin run selected `Travel`, chose
`Bedabin Camp`, and consumed the correct 200-coin fare, but its roughly 40-second flight exceeded the
generic 30-second remote-interaction deadline and caused an engine recovery/surface replan before
landing. Dialogue transports now have their own bounded 60-second command deadline. After rebuilding,
the reverse Bedabin-to-Shantay run selected `Travel` at `23:35:01`, selected `Shantay Pass` at
`23:35:02`, retained navigation-engine ownership throughout the flight, and completed normally at
`23:35:44`. The 200-coin fare was consumed; no recovery, surface replan, or legacy ownership marker
occurred during that accepted request. The temporary transport settings were restored, and the
character was returned to the Shantay-bank side at full Hitpoints.

**Hot-air-balloon slice headless- and representative-live-complete (2026-09-01):** the 51
resource rows (45 basket origins plus six destination-only rows) expand into 225 directed runtime
edges. Every accepted row now retains the exact `Use` / `Basket` / known object-id shape, maps the
requested destination to its exact group-469 button, and carries the destination's one-log
consumable requirement. The resource previously used an unrecognized `Items` header, so the graph
silently dropped every log requirement; the corrected `Item IDs` data and shared bank-planning
predicate now make balloon logs participate in withdrawal planning and sum across repeated trips.
The navigation engine owns the basket, destination-menu, in-flight, and directed-landing stages,
and the pathfinder publishes balloon landmarks so a useful basket off the direct surface line is
considered. Catalog count/classification, malformed-row rejection, staged scanner behavior,
bank-planning, route selection, bounded engine ownership, compile, focused tests, Checkstyle, and
the pathfinder benchmark cover the headless gate. The current account has only Entrana and Taverley
unlocked. A temporary read-only loadout probe confirmed zero equipped items before the Entrana
journey, and the character carried one normal log (`1511`). The first rebuilt-client attempt reached
the Entrana origin but exposed a live-scene mismatch: the catalog uses pre-unlock basket IDs
`19128`/`19129`, while the unlocked Entrana station renders `ZEP_MULTI_BASKET_ENTRANA` (`19133`).
The cache-backed scene now accepts only the official legacy and unlocked station basket variants
(`19128`, `19129`, and odd IDs `19133` through `19143`) near the planned origin and publishes the
actual live object ID. After rebuilding, the accepted `00:47:52` request from
`2807,3357,0` to Taverley `2941,3420,0` published one `HOT_AIR_BALLOON` edge. It issued `Use` at
`00:47:58`, selected `hot-air-balloon-destination:Taverley` at `00:47:59`, consumed the normal log,
and cleared as `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at `00:48:04`. No recovery, surface replan,
`LEGACY_LOCKED`, `processWalk`, or legacy ownership marker occurred in the accepted trace. This is
representative acceptance for the unlocked pair only; the four higher-tier destinations remain
headless-complete rather than live-claimed.

**Remaining Phase 6 transport-classification audit (updated 2026-09-01):** the immutable route classifier
still has no dedicated engine route kind for the following complete catalog families:
`WILDERNESS_OBELISK` (60 source rows). Routes using those rows therefore remain `TRANSPORT` /
`LEGACY_LOCKED`. Hot-air balloons have completed the representative live gate above. The
generic portal catalog is partially migrated as described above:
its 12 ambiguous Guthix rows remained legacy-owned at this historical boundary and were removed on
2026-09-08 as redundant nondeterministic edges. The 286-edge agility/grapple catalog is now
split by an exact production-classifier audit. Of 274 `AGILITY_SHORTCUT` edges, 12 conservative
same-plane direct actions already publish through `ADJACENT_TRANSPORT`, and 248 deterministic,
item-free, scene-changing object interactions publish through `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. Those 248
reuse the established exact catalog object/action resolver, bounded engine command lifecycle, and
directed landing observation; the action allowlist is pinned to the current catalog rather than
admitting future shortcut protocols implicitly. Fourteen agility edges remain `TRANSPORT` /
`LEGACY_LOCKED`: eight `Jump-onto` stepping-stone edges (two inputs each declare two possible
destinations), four adjacent actions outside the existing direct-action contract, one item-gated
`Use;Rope -> Boulder` row, and one anomalous `Grapple;Rocks` row that is not typed as a grapple
shortcut. All 12 `GRAPPLE_SHORTCUT` edges also remain legacy-owned until equipment/tool setup and
restoration have their own explicit contract. Corpus classification, policy/scanner tests, the
broad transport suite, Checkstyle, and the pathfinder benchmark pass. Representative rebuilt-client
live acceptance of the 248-edge catalog-transition slice also passed on the level-5 Falador
crumbling wall. The first approach attempt never issued movement or shortcut input because a
full-screen game interface had removed the minimap widget; a read-only client-thread probe showed
the canvas remained `1889x1009`, camera focus equalled the player, but the minimap widget and both
click projections were unavailable. One Escape restored the normal minimap and on-screen
projections, so that attempt is not counted as an interaction failure. On the accepted reverse run,
request 7/generation 1 started inside Falador, published the directed `2934,3355,0` to
`2936,3355,0` wall edge, and at `01:35:32` issued exactly one
`selection=interaction-catalog_transition stage=Climb-over
action=catalog-transition-interaction issued=true` command. It observed the directed outside
landing and cleared through `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at `01:35:35`. The CLI's stricter
distance-two wrapper reported `success=false` because the normal engine finish tolerance stopped
five tiles from the requested follow-on target; its walker state was `ARRIVED` at the exact catalog
landing. No recovery, replan, `LEGACY_LOCKED`, `processWalk`, duplicate interaction, manual movement,
or ownership handoff occurred. The original disabled agility-shortcut setting was restored.

The first ordinary-transport protocol group is now closed as well. The catalog contains 54 exact
`Climb-over;Stile` rows: four were already engine-owned adjacent transitions, while the remaining
50 item-free, non-adjacent, single-destination rows now use `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The eligibility
boundary requires the exact normalized `Climb-over` action and exact `Stile` name; it does not
admit other ordinary climb-over objects. Rebuilt-client acceptance passed in both directions on
stile `993` at `2917,3438`. Request 3/generation 1 selected
`interaction-catalog_transition`, issued one `Climb-over` at `02:17:08`, observed the directed
west landing at `2916,3438`, and cleared as `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at `02:17:13`.
Request 4/generation 1 issued the symmetric engine-owned command at `02:17:32`, observed the east
landing at `2919,3438`, and arrived at `02:17:35`. Neither accepted trace contained a replan,
recovery, `LEGACY_LOCKED`, `processWalk`, duplicate interaction, manual movement, or ownership
handoff. The CLI wrapper reported `success=false` only because its requested distance-one threshold
is stricter than the engine's normal arrival tolerance; both walker states were `ARRIVED` at the
exact directed catalog landing. After the rebuilt client opened, one initial long approach command
was rejected before movement because the minimap was again hidden by a full-screen interface; one
Escape restored input projection and no transport input had been issued.

The exact ordinary `Climb;Rocks` protocol is now headless-complete. A read-only production-
classifier probe found 55 rows across 55 distinct inputs with no multi-destination ambiguity:
51 non-adjacent and four adjacent. Forty-nine item-free non-adjacent rows now publish through
`CATALOG_TRANSITION`, and the four item-free one-tile rows publish through
`ADJACENT_TRANSPORT`. The policies require the exact normalized `Climb` action and exact `Rocks`
name, so `Climbing rocks` and other climb objects are not admitted implicitly. Two level-15
Agility rows requiring climbing boots (`3105`) remain `TRANSPORT` / `LEGACY_LOCKED`; equipment
setup and restoration are not part of either direct-object lifecycle. The corpus also contains 12
skill-gated and eight quest-gated rows, whose existing route eligibility filtering is unchanged.
The rebuilt production classifier confirms the exact `49 / 4 / 2` kind split. Representative live
acceptance is deliberately deferred because the available clusters are in Troll Country, hazardous
jungle, or dungeons; no character movement or interaction was attempted for this headless slice.

The exact ordinary `Pass;Barrier;32153` protocol is now headless-complete. A read-only production-
classifier probe found 48 rows across 48 distinct inputs, all item-free, same-plane, two-tile
transitions with no multi-destination ambiguity. Local game-value metadata identifies object 32153
as `DS2_LITHKREN_VAULT_BARRIER`, so the policy accepts only the exact normalized `Pass` action,
exact `Barrier` name, and exact object ID 32153; a synthetic neighboring ID remains legacy-locked.
The packaged rows omit a quest requirement and route eligibility is unchanged. After a rebuilt-client
restart, the production classifier confirmed all 48 rows publish through `CATALOG_TRANSITION`.
Representative live acceptance is deliberately deferred because the Dragon Slayer II Lithkren vault
is unavailable to the test account; no character movement or interaction was attempted for this
headless slice.

The exact Ferox Enclave `Pass-Through;Barrier` protocol is now headless-complete. The remaining-
ordinary inventory and a focused production probe found 16 item-free, fare-free, one-tile rows
across 16 distinct inputs with no ambiguity. Game-value metadata identifies IDs 39652 and 39653 as
the normal and mirrored wilderness-hub entry barriers. `AdjacentTransportPolicy` accepts only the
exact normalized action, exact `Barrier` name, those two IDs, and an empty item requirement; wrong
IDs, names, actions, and two-tile shapes remain locked. After a rebuilt-client restart, the
production classifier confirmed all 16 rows publish through `ADJACENT_TRANSPORT`, split evenly
between the two IDs. Live acceptance is deferred because this family sits on the wilderness-facing
Ferox boundary; no character movement or interaction was attempted for this headless slice.

The same production inventory grouped all 2,242 then-remaining ordinary legacy rows before the
Ferox cutover. It confirmed that the large families included 670 wilderness-ditch rows, 92
item-gated jungle-chopping rows, 46 dense-forest rows, and smaller webs, paid ecto barriers,
dialogue/fare routes, and ambiguous multi-destination inputs. Jungle chopping, webs, paid ecto
barriers, and the smaller mixed contracts were still legacy-owned at that audit boundary. Jungle
chopping, deterministic ecto barriers, and exact Wilderness-sword web rows were subsequently split
by the contracts below; the remaining families stay locked until each required item,
warning/dialogue, transformed-object, and landing protocol is isolated.

The exact ordinary `Cross;Wilderness Ditch;23271` family is now headless- and representative-live-
complete behind its own
staged engine interaction. A read-only production probe found 670 rows across 670 distinct directed
inputs, all item-free and fare-free three-tile crossings with no ambiguity. The engine observes the
exact cache-backed object, issues one `Cross`, handles optional warning widget `475:11` as a separate
command, retains ownership while either stage disappears, and acknowledges only at the directed
catalog landing. It does not broaden generic `Cross` rows or rely on the legacy process-loop warning
branch. Policy, scanner, engine-stage, generated-route, broad transport, benchmark, and Checkstyle
tests pass. After a rebuilt-client restart, the production classifier confirmed all 670 rows publish
as `WILDERNESS_DITCH`. Rebuilt-client acceptance passed at the Edgeville boundary on 2026-09-05 with
an empty inventory. South-to-north request 2/generation 1 issued one `Cross` command and one exact
`wilderness-ditch-confirm` command, continued by a single raw-route lookahead, and arrived exactly at
`(3185,3524,0)`. North-to-south request 5/generation 1 issued one `Cross`, continued by one raw-route
lookahead, and arrived exactly at `(3185,3518,0)`. Neither accepted trace contained a replan,
`LEGACY_LOCKED`, `processWalk`, duplicate interaction, or ownership handoff. A manual crossing made
between the completed requests was excluded from the reverse acceptance trace.

The exact ordinary `Enter;Dense forest` protocol is now headless-complete through the existing
`CATALOG_TRANSITION` lifecycle. A rebuilt-client production probe found 46 directed rows across 46
distinct inputs, all item-free, fare-free, same-plane crossings with no ambiguous destinations.
Eligibility requires the exact normalized action and name plus one of the five catalog object IDs
`3937`, `3938`, `3939`, `3998`, or `3999`; unrelated `Enter` objects and neighboring IDs remain
legacy-owned. The cache-backed scene resolves the exact catalog identity, the navigation engine
issues the single interaction, retains ownership while the obstacle animation advances, and clears
only at the directed landing. The rebuilt production classifier confirmed all 46 rows publish as
`CATALOG_TRANSITION`. Focused policy/scanner/corpus tests, the broad transport suite, Checkstyle,
and the pathfinder benchmark pass. Live acceptance is deliberately deferred because the available
obstacles are in hazardous Tirannwn and the account is not positioned for a safe representative
run; no character movement or interaction was attempted for this headless slice.

The exact Neypotzli `Pass-through;Entrance` protocol is now headless-complete through the same
`CATALOG_TRANSITION` lifecycle. The resource previously contained 27 matching rows: 22 internal
links without any quest gate, two stale surface links landing at `(1440,9509,1)`, and a later
three-row surface block landing at the canonical `(1439,9509,1)` coordinate. The stale pair has
been removed, and all 25 canonical rows now require `Perilous Moons=IN_PROGRESS`, matching the
documented requirement that access is gained during the quest rather than only after completion.
Eligibility is frozen to every exact directed route, object ID, normalized `Pass-through` action,
and `Entrance` name; a synthetic route using the same object ID remains legacy-owned. The
fail-first regression first reproduced the 27-row duplicate and missing requirements, then pinned
the corrected count, prerequisites, unambiguous inputs, and engine classification. The unchanged
production-classifier probe reports **1,056** remaining ordinary legacy rows, down from **1,083**;
the generated legacy floor is **1,532**, down from **1,559**, while the loaded transport count is
6,303 after removing the two source duplicates. Compilation, the broad transport, route, core,
and pathfinder-benchmark suite, and both Checkstyle tasks pass. Physical acceptance remains
deferred because the test account has not gained Neypotzli access during Perilous Moons; no
character movement or interaction was attempted for this slice, and Phase 6 remains open.

The exact `Climb-up;Rope` family is now headless-complete through `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The
pre-change rebuilt-client probe found 21 rows but only the existing object-51647 route was
engine-owned. The remaining 20 routes cover Tolna's Rift, two Kalphite Lair exits, Smoke Dungeon,
the two Saradomin God Wars internal ropes, the Chasm of Fire, and the Crash Site Cavern. Their
directed inputs are unique and their immutable object definitions expose `Climb-up`, except for
God Wars object IDs 26371 and 26375: those are varbit-driven wrappers with no usable action until
the permanent ropes have been installed. The four affected resource rows now require installed
state `3967=1` or `3968=1`; this deliberately does not turn rope installation into a banked item
requirement or apply the one-way entry Agility requirement to an exit.

An exact route manifest limits ownership to those 20 newly migrated rows, while the prior route
keeps its existing audited policy. The fail-first regression pins all 21 rows, the exact object-ID
set, unique directed inputs, item- and fare-free requirements, both installed-state predicates,
and synthetic-route exclusion. After rebuilding, the live metadata probe reported `rows=21`,
`supported=21`, current install varbits `0/0`, and `usable=17`; all four God Wars routes were
correctly filtered. The production remainder probe reports **1,036** ordinary legacy rows, down
from **1,056**, and a generated legacy floor of **1,512**, down from **1,532**. Compilation, the
broad transport, route, core, and pathfinder-benchmark suite, and both Checkstyle tasks pass. The
probe was undeployed, and no character movement or interaction was attempted. Physical crossing
acceptance remains deferred because these routes are in hazardous or quest-gated dungeons; the
result is metadata, availability, classification, and rebuilt-client acceptance rather than a live
crossing claim.

The exact `Climb-down;Hole` family is now headless- and negative-live-complete through
`CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The pre-change resource contained 18 legacy-owned rows with no requirements:
three approaches to the Royal Trouble cave hole (object 15203) and 15 approaches to the main God
Wars Dungeon hole (object 26419). Runtime definitions proved that neither base object is an
unconditional `Climb-down`: object 15203 uses varbit 2141 and exposes its action-bearing object
15202 only from quest-stage value 120, while object 26419 uses varbit 3966 and transforms from
`Tie-rope` object 26417 to `Climb-down` object 26418 after permanent setup. The OSRS Wiki evidence
independently confirms that the Royal Trouble dungeon is initially inaccessible until the quest
grants access and that God Wars requires a rope on first entry.

The three Royal Trouble rows now require `2141>119`, and the 15 God Wars rows require `3966=1`.
An exact 18-route manifest prevents unrelated holes or shared object IDs from inheriting ownership;
rope installation remains quest/setup responsibility rather than a fabricated consumable banking
requirement. The fail-first regression reproduced legacy classification, then pinned the exact row
and object-ID sets, unique directed inputs, both activation thresholds, requirement-free inventory
semantics, engine classification, and synthetic-route exclusion. Compilation, the broad transport,
route, core, and pathfinder-benchmark suite, and both Checkstyle tasks pass. The production
remainder probe reports **1,018** ordinary legacy rows, down from **1,036**, and a generated legacy
floor of **1,494**, down from **1,512**. After rebuilding and logging in, the live probe reported
`rows=18`, `supported=18`, varbits `royal=0` and `godWars=0`, and `usable=0`; this proves both locked
states are excluded. The probe was undeployed and the character remained idle at Edgeville. No
physical crossing was attempted, so positive crossing acceptance remains deferred for the relevant
quest/setup state and hazardous dungeon.

The exact `Climb-down;Tunnel entrance` family is now headless-complete through
`CATALOG_TRANSITION`. Its 18 directed links cover eight surface approaches to the outer Kalphite
Lair, eight approaches to the Kalphite Queen chamber, and the two Crabclaw Caves links used by
The Depths of Despair. Runtime object definitions showed that both Kalphite entrance IDs are
varbit-driven wrappers: before setup they expose no climb action, while attaching a rope changes
them to an action-bearing descent. The resource therefore models each Kalphite link as two mutually
exclusive variants: a consumable rope (`954`) setup row at `4586=0` or `11705=0`, and an item-free
installed row at `4586=1` or `11705>0`. Crabclaw Caves now requires
`The Depths of Despair=IN_PROGRESS`, matching access gained during the quest.

The cache-backed scene performs rope setup as two non-blocking engine stages: select the exact rope,
then issue one widget-target-on-object command. If setup only installs the rope, the observed action
advances from `Use rope` to `Climb-down`; if the game descends immediately, normal directed-landing
acknowledgement clears the edge. The Queen chamber's transformed object can expose both
`Climb-down (normal)` and `Climb-down (private)`, so the exact audited family resolves only the normal
action. Bank planning counts one rope per setup edge and can withdraw the consumable requirement.
Fail-first data, action-resolution, stage-advance, and banking tests reproduced the previous gaps,
then passed with the implementation. The broad walker transport and banking suites, route
calculation, shortest-path core, live-collision, cost-model, and benchmark tests all pass, as do both
Checkstyle tasks. This removes 18 ordinary legacy rows, reducing that remainder from **1,018 to
1,000** and the generated legacy floor from **1,494 to 1,476**. On the rebuilt logged-in client, the
corrected read-only probe reported `rows=34 setup=16 installed=16 crabclaw=2 supported=34`, both
Kalphite setup varbits at zero, and `usable=0`; the locked/itemless account therefore publishes none
of these routes. Positive physical crossing remains deferred because the current account lacks the
quest access and the Kalphite routes are hazardous; no character movement or interaction was
attempted.

Follow-up review corrected a setup-to-climb handoff: the scene can observe `Climb-down` before the
filtered transport catalogue replaces its setup row. Dispatch now allows that retained row to
perform the observed climb and selects rope preparation only for the explicit `Use rope` stage.
A regression covers both plain and normal-instance climb actions against a setup-only catalogue.
The two Crabclaw rows also retain their original two-tick duration after correcting its TSV column.

The exact item-gated Kharazi `Chop-down` protocol is now headless-complete behind a dedicated
`JUNGLE_OBSTACLE` route kind. A rebuilt-client production probe found 92 rows across 84 exact
inputs. Seventy-six inputs each have one directed destination and now use engine ownership; eight
inputs each declare two destinations, so their 16 rows remain `TRANSPORT` / `LEGACY_LOCKED` rather
than guessing a landing. Eligibility is pinned to ordinary `TRANSPORT`, exact normalized
`Chop-down`, exact `Jungle Bush` IDs `2892`/`2893` with the machete alternatives
`6313`/`6315`/`6317`/`975`, or exact `Jungle tree` IDs `2889`/`2890` with the catalog's twelve axe
alternatives, a fare-free reusable requirement, and the exact same-plane two-tile geometry. The
cache-backed scene uses `Microbot.getRs2TileObjectCache()`, dispatches one object command without
waiting, retains the pending interaction while the source transforms, and clears only at the
directed landing. The navigation engine owns a bounded 60-second chopping window before requesting
a replan, accommodating repeated Woodcutting attempts without introducing sleeps or a separate
control loop. All 92 rows still participate in `Rs2WalkerBankingPlanner`: inventory and equipment
count toward the requirement, and a bank route withdraws only one available reusable machete or axe
alternative. Focused policy/scanner/corpus/engine tests, the full transport and banking regression
groups, and Checkstyle pass. The rebuilt classifier confirmed the exact
`76 JUNGLE_OBSTACLE / 16 TRANSPORT` split. Live acceptance is deliberately deferred because the
available crossings are in hazardous Kharazi jungle; following the earlier near-death incident, no
character movement or interaction was attempted for this headless slice.

The five exact Brimhaven Dungeon vine boundaries are now included in that same staged lifecycle.
Their ten paired `Chop-down;Vines` rows use dedicated object ids `21731`-`21735`, are same-plane
two-tile crossings, carry no fare or varbit gate, and declare the exact 13 supported axe ids. The
resource represents those ids as singleton groups, while availability and banking deliberately
flatten all encoded ids into one OR-alternative set; the exact policy now compares that normalized
set rather than requiring one particular nested representation. Repeated vine edges therefore plan
one reusable axe, not one axe per edge (and not all 13 variants). A rebuilt production-classifier
probe moved the split from `76 JUNGLE_OBSTACLE / 26 TRANSPORT` to
`86 JUNGLE_OBSTACLE / 16 TRANSPORT`; the remaining 16 are precisely the already-audited ambiguous
Kharazi inputs. Navigation retains the command through temporary object disappearance and clears
only at the directed landing. Live chopping remains deferred: the documented obstacles span
Woodcutting requirements and lie inside a combat dungeon, so no character movement was attempted.

The exact Chasm of Fire lift network is now headless-complete through `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. All 16
rows use object IDs `30258`/`30259`, action/name `Enter;Lift`, no item, fare, quest, or varbit
requirement, and a same-coordinate plane change. The existing cache-backed transition resolver
therefore owns the object interaction and retains it until the directed plane landing; no new
controller or legacy handoff is introduced. A rebuilt production inventory recorded all 16 as
legacy before the cutover and none afterward, reducing the ordinary legacy floor by exactly 16.
The Chasm houses lesser, greater, and black demons, so actual lift interaction remains live-deferred
and no character movement was attempted.

The exact `Slash;Web;733` family is now headless-complete through the adjacent-clearance lifecycle.
All 28 rows have unique directed inputs and destinations: 18 are adjacent and 10 cross a two-tile
web boundary. Each row now declares one reusable OR requirement containing Wilderness swords I-IV
(`13108`-`13111`). Those swords have guaranteed web-cutting success from inventory, so the safe
contract needs neither an arbitrary combat-weapon withdrawal nor an equipment replacement and
restoration cycle. `AdjacentTransportPolicy` accepts only ordinary, fare-free, non-consumable rows
with the exact action, name, object ID, requirement group, same-plane geometry, and distance at most
two; generic positive-slash weapons and Aranea boots are deliberately not inferred into this
contract. The existing cache-backed adjacent scene issues one `Slash`, treats observed object loss
as clearance, and leaves the navigation engine to walk across the now-open local edge. All 28 rows
participate in `Rs2WalkerBankingPlanner`; repeated route edges require one available reusable sword
alternative. Focused policy, classifier, and banking tests plus the broad walker regression suite,
pathfinder benchmark, compilation, and both Checkstyle tasks pass. After a rebuilt-client restart,
the read-only production audit reported
`rows=28 itemGated=28 supported=28 bankPlanned=28`; the probe was undeployed afterward. Most rows
are in hazardous Wilderness or similarly unsafe areas, so no character movement or interaction was
attempted and actual web cutting remains live-deferred.

The Molch Temple subset of `Pass;Mystical barrier` is now headless-complete through the same
adjacent-clearance lifecycle. The production inventory found 20 rows under that action/name, but
their object identity separates two different protocols. Sixteen deterministic two-tile rows use
Molch Temple IDs `34643`-`34646`, carry no item, fare, quest, or destination ambiguity, and now
publish as `ADJACENT_TRANSPORT`. The remaining four ID-`34542` Karuulm rows stay legacy-owned:
crossing farther into the volcanic dungeon without an approved heat-protection boot or the elite
Kourend & Kebos diary can open a warning and then deal rapid repeated damage, which is not encoded
in those catalog rows. The exact policy therefore does not generalize the shared action/name across
that hazard boundary. The cache-backed adjacent scene issues one `Pass`, retains the directed
boundary while the persistent object remains, and acknowledges only from the destination side.
Actual Molch crossing remains live-deferred because the barriers enter level-150 Lizardman shaman
enclosures and passing itself deals one damage; no character movement or interaction was attempted.

The next apparent direct boundary, 11 exact `Pass;Hot vent door;30266` rows in Mor Ul Rek, remains
legacy-owned after audit. The resource records five bidirectional pairs plus one one-way row but no
item, varbit, quest, or other persistent-unlock requirement. Inner-city access requires the account
to have shown a fire cape to the guarding TzHaar, so the action/name/geometry alone is not a complete
eligibility contract. This family must first identify and publish the persistent access state (and
explain the asymmetric row) rather than being admitted by another generic two-tile `Pass` exception.

The 16 exact `Pay-toll(2-Ecto);Energy Barrier;16105` rows were initially split by directed-input
identity: twelve deterministic rows reused `CATALOG_TRANSITION`, while four west-gate rows remained
legacy-owned because the same inputs declared two landings. The 2026-09-04 completion above replaces
that interim boundary with quest-state-exclusive paid/free variants, shared ghostspeak and token
requirements, and compatibility with the modern post-quest `Pass` object. The earlier read-only
`rows=16 supported=12 locked=4 ambiguous=4` result remains historical; the current headless boundary
is `rows=16 supported=16 locked=0`, with physical crossing still live-deferred.

After the staged-item and Cabin Boy Herbert cutovers, the generated-edge legacy floor is 1,687 rows:
`AGILITY_SHORTCUT` 14, `BOAT` 3, `FAIRY_RING` 53, `GRAPPLE_SHORTCUT` 12, `SHIP` 3,
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` 75, `TELEPORTATION_PORTAL` 12, `TELEPORTATION_SPELL` 11,
ordinary `TRANSPORT` 1,186, and `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` 318. These are production-classifier
results over all 12,680 loaded generated entries, not source-line estimates. The count is an audit
boundary, not a claim that every remaining row needs a new family: the 1,186 ordinary rows still
need protocol grouping into safe direct actions, item/tool setup, dialogue, random or multi-stage
interactions, and malformed/duplicate artifacts before any additional ownership cutover.

The exact Fremennik basalt causeway is now headless- and bidirectional-live-complete. Its ten rows
are the five directed pairs using `Basalt rock` IDs `4551`-`4558`, plus the Beach entry ID `4550`
and Rocky shore exit ID `4559`; only their exact `Jump-across`/`Jump-to` identities publish through
`CATALOG_TRANSITION`. This reduces the generated legacy floor from **1,687 to 1,677** and ordinary
legacy rows from **1,186 to 1,176**. Rebuilt-client requests at `19:10:39` and `19:11:17` traversed
the entire chain in opposite directions, emitted engine-owned `interaction-catalog_transition`
commands for every causeway edge, and cleared as `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` with no
legacy ownership marker or relevant client-log error.

The Captain Shanks correction then removes three more legacy entries: two exact `SHIP` rows migrate
to `NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT`, and the nonexistent third destination is removed from the generated
catalogue. The current generated-edge legacy floor is therefore **1,674**: `AGILITY_SHORTCUT` 14,
`BOAT` 3, `FAIRY_RING` 53, `GRAPPLE_SHORTCUT` 12, `SHIP` 0, `TELEPORTATION_ITEM` 75,
`TELEPORTATION_PORTAL` 12, `TELEPORTATION_SPELL` 11, ordinary `TRANSPORT` 1,176, and
`WILDERNESS_OBELISK` 318.

A live pre-rebuild failure also reproduced the stale-edge bug precisely: after the command for the
`2522,3600 -> 2522,3602` jump was issued from `2522,3597`, failure washed the player back to
`2522,3595`, while the pending command kept clicking the later edge. `NavigationEngine` now records
the player position when it issues a short catalog-transition command and requests an immediate
`interaction-displaced-behind-origin` replan when a later observation has moved farther backward
along that edge's directed vector. The regression uses those exact live coordinates and proves that
only one interaction is issued before replanning. After rebuilding, three bounded crossings passed
normally in both directions without damage; RNG did not produce another failure, so the
failure-specific live trace remains intentionally unclaimed. Focused navigation, catalog-policy,
catalog-scanner, production-classification, compilation, and both Checkstyle tasks pass.

**Batching change (2026-09-03):** use the [behaviour-based batch backlog](walker-transport-batches.md)
instead of continuing small object-name slices. The first 128-row jewellery/cape review migrated
99 rows; the second 64-row other-item review migrated 44. The 14 Quetzal-whistle map contracts,
remaining item exceptions, and complete ordinary scene-protocol groups are next.
Candidate counts are not acceptance claims; exact requirements, input
ambiguity, staged warnings, and representative live gates remain mandatory.

The wilderness-obelisk count is a source-file count, not a deterministic edge count: 54 activation
tiles (six 3-by-3 pads) combine with six destination-only rows into 318 runtime transports. Forty-
eight of those generated rows are self-pad artifacts from a perimeter tile to its own centre, leaving
270 genuine remote rows. The legacy handler activates an obelisk and waits for the route's promised
destination, but ordinary obelisk travel is random unless a supported destination-selection
protocol is available. That
nondeterministic/permutation contract must be resolved before the family can safely receive a
directed engine route kind. The audit pins all 318 generated rows as `TRANSPORT` / `LEGACY_LOCKED`:
each of the 54 exact `Activate` inputs declares five genuine remote destinations, so none can prove
the selected edge. The 48 self-pad artifacts are equally unsafe because arrival at the pad centre
does not cancel the delayed random teleport. Wilderness Hard unlocks a separate set-destination/favourite protocol, but the
catalog does not encode that staged input and this account's `WILDERNESS_DIARY_HARD_COMPLETE`
varbit (`4468`) is `0`. No wilderness live probe was attempted. A future deterministic migration
must require the diary unlock, model destination setup plus pad activation/waiting as distinct
stages, and observe the selected landing; random activation cannot be accepted as success.

The already sliced mixed catalogs also intentionally retain unsupported row shapes: item/spell
teleports needing destination submenus, wilderness confirmation, Master Scroll Book, multi-option
spell flows; `BOAT`/`SHIP`/`NPC` rows using `Talk-to`, non-coin
currency, item gates, or named bespoke conversations; charter rows outside the coin-only contract;
and ordinary `TRANSPORT` rows outside the accepted adjacent and ladder/stair/trapdoor/cave/
gangplank policies. POH
physical Home/Enter is accepted, but portal chambers, nexus, jewellery box,
mounted teleports, POH fairy ring, and POH spirit tree remain explicitly live-deferred. Seasonal
rows remain headless-complete/live-deferred on League availability. This audit is the Phase 6
backlog boundary; it does not authorize deleting `processWalk` or starting Phase 7.

**Rebuilt-client Phase 6 remainder audit (2026-09-05):** a read-only production-classifier probe
loaded 12,672 generated edges and found 1,624 still classified as `TRANSPORT` before the home-
teleport cutover: ordinary `TRANSPORT` 1,129, `WILDERNESS_OBELISK` 318,
`TELEPORTATION_ITEM` 75, multi-code `FAIRY_RING` 53, `AGILITY_SHORTCUT` 14,
`GRAPPLE_SHORTCUT` 12, ambiguous `TELEPORTATION_PORTAL` 12, and
`TELEPORTATION_SPELL` 11. The ordinary remainder contains 51 item-gated rows, 12 fare rows,
51 quest-gated rows, 58 var-state-gated rows, 196 remote/plane-changing rows, 270 adjacent rows,
and 52 executable-input groups with multiple declared destinations. These dimensions overlap and
are audit evidence, not safe-migration counts. The probe was undeployed without game input.

The same audit reproduced the day's legacy fallback: a route from Port Phasmatys selected the exact
originless `Lumbridge Home Teleport` edge, and that single unsupported edge locked the whole request
to `processWalk`. That exact spell is now admitted as `SIMPLE_TELEPORT`, receives a bounded
35-second cast/landing deadline, and remains pending until its directed Lumbridge landing rather
than being retired by projected raw-route progress. The other ten spell rows at that historical
boundary were destination-override contracts (eight Teleport to House locations,
Watchtower-to-Yanille, and Varrock-to-GE). The 2026-09-08 exact alternate-destination cutover above
supersedes that deferral and reduces the spell remainder to zero. Policy, delayed-cast retry,
remote-retention, production-count, and focused navigation tests passed for the original direct-
spell slice, reducing its then-current headless legacy floor to 1,623.
Rebuilt-client acceptance passed at **2026-09-05 01:49 BST** after the strict 30-minute cooldown
gate became usable. With competing transport networks temporarily disabled, the route from
`(1884,3481,0)` to `(3221,3218,0)` published exactly one
`selection=interaction-simple_teleport stage=Lumbridge Home Teleport` command at `01:49:06`,
retained NavigationEngine ownership throughout the approximately 16-second cast, landed at
`(3222,3219,0)`, issued the final one-tile `route-end-approach`, and cleared as
`rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived` at the exact target. No `LEGACY_LOCKED` or `processWalk`
ownership appeared. All temporary transport settings were restored after the run. Phase 6 remains
open for the audited remainder and Phase 7 has not started.

**Enakhra's Temple sand-pile exits (2026-09-05, headless):** all 16 exact
`Climb;Sand pile;10950` rows now reuse `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The allowlist pins the object ID,
action, and name, while the production-corpus regression confirms all 16 directed rows publish
through NavigationEngine and no broader sand object is admitted. Cache metadata identifies `10950`
as the temple sand pile, and the OSRS Wiki documents climbing the sand pile as the direct way out;
the separate unlock restriction applies to entering from the surface after first leaving through
an exit, so this cutover deliberately owns only the already-published underground-to-surface rows.
Focused policy/classifier tests and main/test Checkstyle pass. This reduces ordinary legacy rows
from **1,129 to 1,113** and the generated legacy floor from **1,623 to 1,607**. Physical acceptance
remains deferred until an eligible account is safely inside the quest temple.

**Frozen direct-transition manifest (2026-09-05, headless):** 30 generated rows across 13 exact
object IDs now reuse `CATALOG_TRANSITION`. The tranche covers Nature Grotto enter/exit, the paired
Tree Gnome Village huge gates, Elf Village tree-gate crossings, Magic Training Arena doorway
crossings, Polar hunting-area steps, the Hunter Guild rope, the exact `DOTI_BARRIER` entryway, and
the paired Custodia Pass cave. Each manifest entry pins its directed origin and destination, object
ID, normalized action, and exact object name. It therefore cannot admit a new catalog row merely
because that row later gains a familiar verb or name. The shared scene adapter still issues one
exact object interaction and NavigationEngine retains ownership until the directed landing clears.

The broad structural candidate was deliberately narrowed before acceptance. Fremennik/Troll tunnel
rows previously audited as requirement-incomplete, damaging Slayer Tower spikey chains, Darkmeyer
agility walls, Karuulm heat-floor links, Wilderness/God Wars routes, paid or warning entrances, and
all item/fare/quest/var-gated candidates remain legacy-owned. A fail-first classifier run exposed
the tunnel overreach and passed after removal. Exact endpoint/action/name/ID mutation regressions,
the existing 39-row tunnel lock regression, catalog landing/scanner tests, NavigationEngine tests,
compilation, Pathfinder benchmark, and both Checkstyle tasks pass. This reduces ordinary legacy
rows from **1,113 to 1,083** and the generated legacy floor from **1,607 to 1,577**. Physical route
acceptance passed on the rebuilt client for the Magic Training Arena doorway in both directions.
At **02:42 BST**, requests `(3363,3298,0) -> (3363,3300,0)` and the exact reverse each issued one
`selection=interaction-catalog_transition stage=Enter` command, landed on the directed endpoint,
and cleared as `rs2walker:navigation-engine:arrived`; neither trace contained a legacy ownership
marker, replan, or duplicate interaction. Other manifest families remain physical-live-deferred.
The optional dynamic-probe deployment endpoint returned `404`, so no runtime probe was left
installed and no metadata-only result is claimed.

**Master Scroll Book cutover (2026-09-05, headless):** all 18 exact book destinations now publish
through the engine-owned `ITEM_TELEPORT` lifecycle. The interaction advances from the inventory tab
to the book's exact `Open` action, then to the generated `InterfaceID.Bookofscrolls` destination
component, and retains the directed edge until the declared landing. Revenant Cave adds the exact
`Yes, teleport me now` confirmation as a separate stage and remains subject to the existing
wilderness and transport configuration gates. The catalog's per-destination varbit still owns
stored-scroll availability. Banking treats item `21389` as one reusable container even though the
row is marked consumable for its stored charge, so repeated edges withdraw one book rather than
inventing multiple physical books. Focused policy, staged-lifecycle, banking, and classifier tests
cover all 18 rows. This reduces item-teleport legacy rows from **75 to 57** and the generated legacy
floor from **1,577 to 1,559**. Physical acceptance remains pending because all 18 stored-scroll
varbits are zero on the active account; any Revenant Cave acceptance must use an empty inventory
and equipment loadout.

**Landing catalog-disappearance finding (2026-08-24):** the next two-direction run still emitted no
restore stage. Request 2 captured and equipped Dramen staff `772`, but the landing inventory refresh
could remove the fairy row from the usable transport snapshot once that required staff was no longer
in inventory. `Rs2FairyRingScene.restore` then failed its unnecessary transport rediscovery and
returned `null`, clearing the pending edge. Restoration now uses the immutable pending origin,
destination, and original weapon id; it no longer depends on the mutable eligibility catalog.

**Landing equipment-cache gap (2026-08-24):** live testing after that change still skipped the restore
command. Immediately after the teleport/staff swap, the original weapon can briefly be visible in
neither inventory nor equipment. That absence is now an unsettled wait state; restoration completes
only when the saved weapon ID is observed equipped. A later trace proved this defensive condition was
not the cause of the skipped command.

**Remote-edge retirement finding (2026-08-24):** the navigation engine's remote-landing guard covered
NPC transports and charter ships but omitted `FAIRY_RING`. Landing advanced raw progress beyond the
fairy edge, so generic crossed-edge retirement deleted the pending restore interaction before dispatch.
Fairy rings now participate in both remote-edge guards, and the engine test reproduces the landing
progress jump while requiring both restore commands before the edge can retire.

**Completed dialogue/menu NPC implementation record:** the family was scoped (2026-08-05) in
three steps. Step 0 fixes a latent hole found in the accepted direct NPC/ship slice:
`NpcTransportPolicy` admits object-backed rows (Swamp Boaty `Board`, Tempoross `Ferry`, Fremennik
`Boat`, the DS2/Lithkren `Rowboat` rows, Lunar Isle `Go-inside;House`), but `Rs2NpcTransportScene`
resolves actors only through the NPC cache, so an engine-owned route through one of those edges
can never publish its interaction and stalls to bounded terminal failure at the frontier. Step 0
is implemented (2026-08-05): `Rs2NpcTransportScene` now falls back to a tile object near the
catalog origin — the exact catalog id, or a transformed id with the exact catalog name, in both
cases requiring the catalog action under hyphen/space-insensitive formatting — the pending
interaction keeps the catalog id, and dispatch clicks the resolved live action string through the
shared tile-object path. Policy, broad walker, and Checkstyle tests pass. Its live gate is one
object-backed route in both directions: the free, ungated Al Kharid Tempoross Ferry
(`Board;Ferry;41311`, Al Kharid bank side `3271,3144,0` to Ruins of Unkah `3148,2843,0`).
Step 0 is accepted (2026-08-05): forward and reverse Tempoross Ferry runs each issued exactly one
object-backed `npc-transport-interaction`, held one request/generation through the crossing,
acknowledged the catalog landing, and finished — the forward run arrived within the finish
tolerance of the landing, the reverse run resumed ordinary walking from the landing to the goal —
with no recovery, replan, duplicate input, or legacy markers. Step 1 is
the conservative dialogue slice behind a new `NPC_DIALOGUE_TRANSPORT` route kind: NPC/SHIP/BOAT
rows with a direct non-`Talk-to` action, non-blank `Display info`, no currency, and no item
requirements (Mountain Guide, Achilka, Primio, Cabin Boy Colin, Veos/Cabin Boy Herbert/Captain
Magoro, Molch Boaty, the Fossil Island underwater Rowboat menu, the Burgh de Rott/Meiyerditch
Boat). Reuse the charter staged-interaction pattern with stages observed from live dialogue state,
never assumed: actor click, zero-or-more bounded `Continue` clicks (each is one command in one
pass), an optional select-an-option stage matched against normalized `Display info` (numbered
options such as `1: Meiyerditch.` require tag/whitespace-normalized contains-matching), then
voyage retention with off-route recovery suppressed and clearing only near the directed catalog
landing — rows whose action is itself the destination may sail with no dialogue at all, exactly
like charter's optional confirmation stage. Step 1's code and headless tests are complete
(2026-08-05): the policy, staged scene over live chat-dialogue state, route scanner,
classification, engine landing/timeout ownership, and dispatch all mirror the charter pattern.
The actor stage resolves an NPC (catalog id preferred, transformed id with exact name/action and
origin proximity) or a tile object via the step-0 rules; destination options are matched exactly,
never by contains, so prefixed pairs such as Molch and Molch Island cannot be confused; a menu
without the declared option is treated as foreign and never receives input. Policy, scanner,
classification, mutual-exclusivity, broad walker, and Checkstyle suites pass. Lake Molch Boaty
live acceptance passed in both directions (2026-08-05): each run issued one object-actor command
and two dialogue-stage commands (Boaty presents a continue frame plus its destination menu — a
same-stage duplicate is impossible because a pending interaction command only yields to an
observed stage whose action string differs), held one request/generation, acknowledged the
catalog landing, resumed ordinary walking, and arrived without recovery or legacy markers. The
Shayzien-to-Molch run also proved exact option matching by selecting `Molch` while `Molch Island`
was offered. `nav_cmd` interaction lines now include `stage=` so later staged families read
directly from the log. Before the slice closes, one NPC-backed representative should pass both
live directions, because Molch exercised only the object-actor path: Captain Magoro at Land's
End (`1504,3399,0`, action `Port Sarim`, ungated) is the suggested route and chains a Port Sarim
gangplank landing. Live observation confirmed his shape: the destination-named right-click
action sails immediately with no dialogue, while left-click Talk-to opens a conversation whose
menu phrases each destination as a sentence (`Can you take me to Port Sarim please?`). The first
attempt showed the legacy executor stuck talking to him through that Talk-to path, so destination
matching now prefers an exact option and otherwise accepts only a single option containing the
destination text — ambiguous containment is still refused, preserving the Molch/Molch Island
guard — which also lets an engine run recover by menu selection and `CONTINUE` frames if an actor
click ever lands on Talk-to instead of the travel action. That attempt also exposed that a route
which locks to the legacy executor did so silently: a `nav_mode` line now names the unsupported
edges and their catalog rows once per request. That line identified the live lock:
`PathfinderConfig.updateActionBasedOnQuestState` rewrote the Veos and Captain Magoro rows to
`Talk-to` whenever Client of Kourend was not `FINISHED`. Live observation on an account without
that quest showed the right-click travel option works regardless — the gate modelled a game
behaviour that no longer exists, and its one-way mutation additionally poisoned the shared row
for a whole session on any early quest-state misread. The mutation is deleted; rows keep their
catalog actions, and no runtime code rewrites transport actions anymore. `nav_mode` remains the
tool for diagnosing any future legacy lock. With the gate gone, both NPC-backed live directions
then passed (2026-08-05): Land's End-to-Port-Sarim issued exactly one Magoro actor command
(`stage=Port Sarim`, exact catalog id, immediate sail with no dialogue stages), chained the ship
gangplank as one `CATALOG_TRANSITION`, and arrived on one request/generation with no recovery;
Port-Sarim-to-Land's-End issued one Veos actor command (`stage=Land's End`, exact id 10724),
sailed, and landed cleanly. The dialogue-slice live gates — object actor both directions at
Molch, NPC actor both directions here — are complete. The reverse run's chained gangplank then
exposed a general race in the already-accepted catalog-transition family: two seconds after a
successful `Cross` command, the scene transiently failed to re-resolve the object mid-crossing
and the pending interaction read `INTERACTION_UNAVAILABLE`, forcing a needless replan (the walk
still arrived). An in-flight interaction command now owns its interaction until the
acknowledgement deadline: an `UNAVAILABLE` observation inside that window yields `WAIT`, and only
persistent unavailability past the deadline replans. A headless regression pins both halves; the
fix should be observed live in passing on any future slow crossing. Step 2, only after step 1
closes, adds the coin-paid confirmation variants (Captain Tobias, Captain Barnaby, Antonia, Swamp
Boaty `Quick-board`, the 10,000-coin Slepe `Row boat`, Dwarven Ferryman) with fare evidence
reported as bounded `INTERACTION_UNAVAILABLE` and a `Yes` confirmation stage; non-coin currencies
(Ghost captain's Ecto-tokens) wait for that sub-slice to prove the pattern first. Step 2's code
and headless tests are complete (2026-08-05): eligibility now also accepts coin-paid rows
(`Display info` optional for single-destination confirm-only flows such as Swamp Boaty
`Quick-board`), the model carries a `CONFIRM` stage and the fare, and the scene recognises the
payment prompt as the single option starting with an affirmative word — checked only after
destination matching and only for paid rows, so free rows keep their exact step-1 semantics and
ambiguity is still refused. The scanner fare-gates only the actor stage against the live coin
count, reporting a missing fare as bounded `INTERACTION_UNAVAILABLE`; an open dialogue is never
fare-gated. The staged shapes were verified against Captain Tobias's transcript: pre-Pandemonium
is continue-then-confirm (`Yes please.` vs `No, thank you.`), post-Pandemonium adds a
destination menu whose sentence options the existing unique-containment matcher selects. Policy,
scene, scanner, mutual-exclusivity, broad walker, shortestpath, and Checkstyle suites pass. The
remaining gate is live acceptance: Port Sarim to Musa Point and back (Captain Tobias at
`3029,3217,0` out, Customs officer at `2956,3146,0` back, 30 Coins each way, each landing on a
ship deck chaining a gangplank `CATALOG_TRANSITION`), with the usual criteria and `stage=`
showing `dialogue-confirm` for each payment click. The first live attempt was engine-owned but
exhausted its route at the dock without proposing the interaction: the Sailing rework
(2025-11-19) replaced these NPCs, so the catalog ids were defunct (`3644`/`3648`) and the
declared `Musa Point`/`Port Sarim` actions no longer exist — the live NPCs are
`captain_tobias_1op` 14978 / `customs_officer_1op` 14984 with a `Travel` action, and their
`_2op` post-Pandemonium variants expose destination-named actions instead. The two ships.tsv
rows are corrected (`Travel`, new default-variant ids, `Display info` retained), and
`matchLiveNpcAction` now accepts the declared destination as a direct action when the catalog
action is absent, so one row covers both quest-state variants. Bounded `ROUTE_EXHAUSTED` was the
correct failure shape for an unresolvable published interaction. The rerun with corrected
identity then proved the new `Travel` op pays and sails directly with no dialogue — one actor
command (`stage=Travel`), fare deducted, voyage — so the confirm stage stayed correctly unused
and its live exercise waits for a family member that actually presents a prompt. That run also
exposed the third staleness axis: the live boat lands directly on the Musa Point dock
(`2956,3146,0`) rather than the catalog's ship deck (`2956,3143,1`), so the pending interaction
could not clear until its 30-second window expired and a bounded replan finished the walk. Both
rows' destinations are now the observed dockside landings (`2956,3146,0` /
`3029,3217,0`), eliminating the phantom gangplank edge. Post-Sailing staleness therefore has
three axes for the queued ship/boat audit: NPC id, action name, and landing destination. With
identity, action, and landing all corrected, both live directions then passed cleanly
(2026-08-05): each run issued exactly one `stage=Travel` actor command, satisfied the fare gate
with coins held, paid, sailed, cleared the pending interaction immediately at the dockside
landing, and arrived on one request/generation with no recovery, replan, dialogue stage, or
legacy marker. The Tobias/Customs officer pair is accepted as the paid slice's first
representative. Captain Barnaby then exposed the actor-anchor gap: his catalog origin is a route
anchor, and he wanders the Ardougne pier up to eight tiles from it (live id exactly 9250), so
the 3-tile same-plane matcher refused him and the engine-owned route exhausted at the frontier —
diagnosed and reproduced end-to-end over the agent server. Actor matching now accepts the exact
name/action within fifteen 2D tiles of the origin on any plane, readiness fires from the actor's
vicinity or the route frontier, and NPC dispatch gates on one dispatch-time walkability check —
per the recorded ranged-dispatch invariant (one click on any loaded, reachable target; never
walk-adjacent-then-click; never line-of-sight or per-candidate reachability sweeps). The
agent-driven Ardougne-to-Brimhaven retest then passed with the whole journey as exactly two
commands — one ranged `stage=Brimhaven` click on the wandered actor and one ship-deck gangplank
`Cross` — no ordinary movement clicks, no recovery, one generation. Barnaby also pays directly,
so with the Brimhaven-to-Ardougne direction already clean, every live-tested paid row pays
without a prompt. Step 2 is closed (2026-08-05) with the `CONFIRM` stage headless-proven only:
post-Sailing, ships that converse before sailing are the charter family, which is already
migrated with its own staged confirmation. The dialogue-stage confirm is conservative by
construction — an unmatched prompt stalls bounded rather than misclicking — and will validate in
passing if a prompting coin row ever appears live. The dialogue-menu family (free and paid) is
therefore complete. The later specialised `Talk-to` slices migrated Cabin Boy Herbert and the two
corrected Captain Shanks destinations, Pirate Pete's two quest-finished conversation rows, and Ghost
Captain's outbound combined-item-and-currency row. The dedicated `BOAT`/`SHIP` family is now
headless-complete, with the latter three quest-gated routes still awaiting live acceptance. After this
family: fairy rings, spirit trees, gliders, quetzals, POH, seasonal transports,
and other specialised transports, with banked-transport route setup last within Phase 6. Do not
classify an entire `TransportType` as engine-owned unless its complete UI/dialogue/landing
lifecycle is modelled and tested. Phases 7 and 8 (thin `ShortestPathPlugin`, collapse facade,
delete legacy orchestration) have not started.

**Post-Sailing ship/boat catalog audit (2026-08-05):** the queued audit of every remaining
ships.tsv and boats.tsv NPC row is complete (canoes and minecarts were inspected and are
object-only, so unaffected). Sources: post-Sailing wiki infoboxes (Options row plus advanced-data
ids), the vendored 1.12.35 `gameval.NpcID` cache constants, and the upstream shortest-path
project's post-Sailing data as a field-tested cross-check. The central finding is that the
Sailing rework's dock-NPC renumbering block (`14978`–`14985`) covers only the Port
Sarim–Musa Point dock — Captain Tobias, Seaman Lorris, Seaman Thresnor, Customs officer — so no
other ferry NPC in either file was renumbered by Sailing; the wiki still lists every other row's
id as live. Note the cache retains defunct definitions (`CAPTAIN_TOBIAS = 3644` still exists
beside `CAPTAIN_TOBIAS_1OP = 14978`), so id existence in `NpcID` proves nothing about
placement — the wiki infobox is the liveness source. Verified correct as-is: Captain Barnaby
(`9250`/`8764`/`8763`, destination-named actions), Cabin Boy Colin `7967`, Barge guard `8012`
`Quick-Travel`, Captain Shanks `5364` (`Talk-to`; the corrected Khazard Port and Port Sarim rows are
engine-owned), Bill Teach `4016`, Sailor `3936`/`3680`, Captain Bentley `6650`, Captain Magoro
`7471`, Monk of Entrana `1165`/`1168` (`Take-boat` confirmed by the wiki Options row; upstream's
`Travel-boat` divergence was checked and rejected), Squire `1770`/`1769`, Antonia
`13984`/`13985`, Holgart `7789`/`5070`, Pirate Pete `601`/`602`, Ghost captain `3005` at both
ends, Mord/Maria Gunnars `1900`/`1940`/`1883`/`1882`, Lokar Searunner `3855`/`9306`, Lumdo
`1454`, Sandicrahb `7483`/`7484`, and all object-backed rows. Four defects were fixed, all
pre-Sailing staleness rather than Sailing casualties: (1) Jarvald's Rellekka-side id `6535` no
longer spawns — the wiki lists `5937`/`7205`, `7205` being the one-op pre-quest variant, so the
row now uses `5937`; (2) the River Kelda rows carried nonsense ids (`13825`/`13826`/`13829` are
Death on the Isle NPCs, `17768` a POH fireplace) and now use Dwarven Boatman `7726`
(mines, post-quest) / `2433` (city) and Dwarven Ferryman `4896` (entrance) / `4897` (mines);
(3) Veos reused `10724` for every origin and now carries the per-origin live ids `8630` (Port
Sarim) / `10726` (Piscarilius), keeping destination-named actions; (4) Cabin Boy Herbert's rows
declared destination-named actions that do not exist — the live NPC exposes only `Talk-to` — so
the rows now declare `Talk-to` with per-origin ids `10933` (Sarim) / `10932` (Piscarilius) and
retain `Display info`. That makes Herbert legacy-owned by the talk-to exclusion, and the legacy
Veos `Talk-to` dialogue branch in `Rs2Walker` now also accepts Cabin Boy Herbert — his
transcript has the identical shape (`Can you take me somewhere?` then `Travel to <dest>.`
options matched by `Display info` containment). Since live matching is name-plus-action in both
executors, the action fixes are the load-bearing part; id fixes restore honest catalog identity.
The audit covered the id and action axes; the third axis (landing destinations) is only proven
for Tobias/Customs and remains a live-run concern per family. For the still-unproven `CONFIRM`
stage, the paid rows most likely to present a payment prompt are Captain Barnaby (30 Coins,
destination ops) and the Dwarven Ferryman (2 Coins); Shanks (50 Coins) is a `Talk-to`
conversation and stays legacy.

**Latest defect fixed:** the Port Sarim TSV row correctly names Trader Crewmember id `9342`, but the
loaded actor transformed to live id `9377`. Charter resolution now prefers the catalog id and permits
a transformed id only with exact name, exact `Charter` action, correct plane, and proximity to the
directed catalog origin. The initial forward run's pre-charter
`COMMAND_DESTINATION_MISMATCH` was the already-isolated physical-mouse/natural-mouse input race, not
a charter failure.

**Validation at handover:** `:client:compileJava`, `:client:compileTestJava`, focused charter tests,
the broad `net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.util.walker.*` unit suite, `checkstyleMain`,
`checkstyleTest`, and `git diff --check` all pass. The central implementation is in
`navigation/NavigationEngine.java`, `navigation/PathfinderRouteCalculation.java`, and
`Rs2Walker.java`; charter-specific policy, scanner, live scene, and model classes are under
`util/walker/transport/`. Movement gotchas 39-44 document the accepted transport assumptions.

## Execution status

- **Phase 0 complete (2026-08-04):** full headless unit baseline green; public API inventory
  recorded in `walker-api-inventory.md`; architecture guardrails enforce the facade boundary,
  prohibit lifecycle ownership in interaction handlers, and prevent legacy `processWalk` growth.
- **Phase 1 complete (2026-08-04):** `RoutePlannerRuntime` is the single production owner of
  pathfinder tasks. Request/preparation/generation identities reject stale work; completed routes
  publish immutable `RoutePlan` snapshots; the old plugin executor/Future/mutex and all lifecycle
  setters are deleted. `getPathfinder()` remains temporarily read-only for the legacy executor and
  overlays until Phase 2 consumes snapshots.
- **Phase 2 complete (2026-08-04):** `NavigationEngine` exclusively owns an instance-scoped
  `WalkSession` and publishes immutable `NavigationSnapshot` diagnostics. Real walker heartbeats,
  replans, interaction/exit classifications, route generations, and terminal clears feed the
  engine in shadow mode; its decisions are logged/compared but cannot issue input. Headless shadow
  traces cover transitions, monotonic progress, one-command-per-pass, cancellation, interaction
  frontiers, and recovery-budget deferral. An architecture guard prohibits input dependencies.
- **Phase 3 in progress (2026-08-04):** immutable plans now contain explicit raw edges and a
  one-time smoothed-to-raw mapping. Requests snapshot an opt-in ordinary-engine flag and lock to
  `ENGINE_SUPPORTED` or `LEGACY_LOCKED` when their first plan arrives; that choice cannot change on
  later generations. The new loop sends at most one movement command through `WalkerActions`,
  tracks acknowledgement, replans rejected/off-route movement, and handles arrival, replacement,
  partial/empty routes, and cancellation. Transport or non-adjacent edges are conservatively
  ineligible. Initial live acceptance exposed LOS-shaped click placement; selection now advances
  7-10 bounded steps on the forward raw route, can cross smoothed/LOS corners, stops before repeated
  folded-route coordinates, and never geometrically clamps a rejected route click off the route.
  Each issued checkpoint also carries a 2-4 tile proximity handoff window, allowing the next raw
  checkpoint to be selected while movement is still in flight without retargeting a final route
  command. `nav_cmd` diagnostics report raw/smoothed indices, Euclidean distance, reach, handoff,
  selection tier, adapter action, and issuance result. The developer flag remains off by default
  pending further live acceptance routes; the legacy ordinary-click branches remain until that
  gate passes.
- **Phase 4 complete (2026-08-04):** engine-owned ordinary walks now keep recovery evidence and
  per-cause budgets in `WalkSession`, distinguishing rejected/unacknowledged commands, no tile
  progress, off-route movement, live blocked edges, interaction waits, route exhaustion, and
  external replans. A settled no-progress command gets one shorter raw-route rejoin click before a
  bounded replan; recent or in-flight valid commands defer recovery without spending its budget.
  Live-collision validation queues a generation-scoped blocked-edge observation for the engine
  instead of independently recalculating, and a repeated edge can request only one replan per
  generation. `nav_cmd` now includes the engine decision reason, while recovery clicks, replans,
  and terminal failures emit one `nav_recovery` record containing cause, attempt/budget, evidence
  age, blocked-edge index, raw progress, and route distance. Live acceptance caught repeated
  proximity commands to the same raw index; handoffs now select strictly beyond the active command,
  and an acknowledged command with no raw progress waits for the recovery evidence window instead
  of resetting that window with another ordinary click. Movement acknowledgement now samples the
  destination registered by the client: a newly registered route-backed destination or actual
  forward raw-route progress acknowledges a dispatched command, while a clearly divergent
  destination immediately consumes its own bounded recovery category and emits a mismatch-only
  `nav_ack` diagnostic. A no-progress recovery without a valid short rejoin target remains
  classified as `NO_TILE_PROGRESS` and replans without spending the route-exhaustion budget.
  Live acceptance covered uninterrupted long routes, manual displacement, physical-mouse input
  contention, and successful recovery through arrival. Engine-owned requests return before the
  legacy `processWalk` recovery block, so legacy `stuckCount` and interaction recovery are retained
  only for `LEGACY_LOCKED` routes until their Phase 5/6 migrations; they cannot compete for an
  ordinary-engine request. The ordinary-engine flag remains off by default pending the Phase 3
  deletion/cutover decision.
- **Phase 5 in progress (2026-08-04):** the first dynamic-obstacle slice migrates Motherlode
  rockfalls. `RouteInteraction` now carries the blocking raw edge, object tile, action,
  availability, and approach readiness into the engine. `WalkSession` retains the interaction
  across passes while the engine separately approaches, issues one non-blocking mine command,
  verifies object clearance, and keeps the interaction pending until the route edge is crossed.
  Missing-pickaxe evidence is reported as bounded `INTERACTION_UNAVAILABLE` recovery instead of
  letting the handler replan or clear the walk target. Live object classification remains behind
  `LiveScene`/`MineableResolver`; the old blocking `handleRockfall` scans remain reachable only on
  `LEGACY_LOCKED` routes. The first live Motherlode
  route successfully mined and arrived, but also exposed that `getGameObject(WorldPoint)` treats
  its point as a search anchor and can select an adjacent object. Classification and dispatch now
  require an exact object anchor. The repeat route passed; it also showed that waiting beside a
  blocker before interacting retained legacy-style approach clicks. Loaded mineables within the
  bounded 13-tile handler frontier now dispatch while ordinary ground movement is still active,
  allowing the server to finish the approach. Post-clear movement is limited to crossing that raw
  edge, followed by a scanner-only observation, so ordinary lookahead cannot skip a second nearby
  blocker. Forward and reverse live routes now pass this sequence, completing mineable acceptance
  for engine-owned routes. The ordinary-door slice now snapshots standard door/gate candidates,
  matches wall objects to the exact crossed edge and single-tile game objects to a route endpoint,
  and feeds the earliest door-or-mineable interaction into the same lifecycle. Only `Open`,
  `Walk-through`, `Go-through`, and `Pass` are initially eligible; special/dialogue, catalog-backed,
  cross-plane, and instanced cases remain legacy-owned pending later slices. Reverse multi-door
  live acceptance chained three successive doors, including a 17-tile server-pathing handoff, and
  arrived. Ordinary doors/gates are accepted for engine-owned routes; the same chaining behavior is
  now required for each later transport and shortcut family.
- **Phase 6 in progress (2026-08-04):** route publication now distinguishes migrated adjacent
  same-plane catalog transports from unsupported transports. Only one-tile, object-backed,
  direct-action rows (`Open`, `Pass`, `Walk-through`, `Go-through`, `Climb-over`,
  `Climb-through`, `Squeeze-through`, `Cross`, and `Vault`) are initially eligible. Toll,
  lock-pick, NPC/dialogue, arbitrary `Use`, destructive-object actions, non-adjacent, cross-plane,
  and specialised transport families remain legacy-owned. Eligible catalog edges enter the same
  pending interaction, exact-edge crossing, collision ownership, arrival guard, and chaining
  lifecycle already accepted for ordinary doors and mineables. The execution-mode name is now
  `ENGINE_SUPPORTED` because engine ownership is no longer limited to transport-free routes.
  Initial live acceptance began within the configured destination tolerance on the opposite side
  of a catalog door and exposed premature arrival before the edge was crossed. Distance-based
  arrival is now gated by every uncrossed engine-owned interaction edge in the published route;
  this remains true when an `Open` object is absent because the door is already open. A subsequent
  Al Kharid toll-gate route exposed two older ownership leaks: door-like catalog objects were
  deliberately exempted from the catalog guard, and a diagonal raw step could cross one lane of a
  double gate without exactly matching either TSV edge. Catalog ownership now wins regardless of
  door-like naming/action, and directed edge matching recognises those adjacent parallel lanes.
  Toll and quest-gated rows therefore remain legacy-owned rather than entering the ordinary-door
  lifecycle. Repeat acceptance then showed that a transformed live gate id could still let the
  ordinary scanner tie with the catalog scanner, with the earlier ordinary result winning.
  Ordinary scanning now considers only published `WALK` edges, while the adjacent-transport scene
  resolves a transformed id only when its exact boundary, object name, and action match the
  catalog row. Reverse acceptance then opened the gate but exposed the old one-tile post-clear
  minimap nudge: the adjacent click was not acknowledged, each replan rediscovered the gate, and
  the walk looped until a later attempt crossed. When no next interaction is published, cleared
  interactions now continue to the next bounded forward raw-route checkpoint. The one-edge nudge
  remains only as a guarded fallback and prefers a canvas click to avoid the minimap centre dead
  zone. Interaction acknowledgement is also distance-aware, so a ranged object click does not
  expire and redispatch while the server is still walking the player to the object. A further
  forward run proved that time alone is not sufficient: the first ranged click crossed the gate,
  but the persistent gate object was redispatched from its destination side and pulled the player
  back. Pending adjacent transports now retain the catalog row's real directed boundary and clear
  as soon as the player reaches or passes its destination side, even when the raw route used the
  neighbouring lane of a double gate and the object remains interactable. Final westbound and
  eastbound Al Kharid acceptance each issued exactly one adjacent-transport interaction followed
  by one forward route command, stayed on generation 1, and arrived without recovery. The
  adjacent same-plane transport slice is live-accepted.
  The second Phase 6 slice is now implemented behind a separate `CATALOG_TRANSITION` route kind.
  It covers direct object-backed stairs, ladders, trapdoors, and caves whose action is a bounded
  climb/walk/enter/exit operation, while currency, item-use, dialogue, `Open`-only, and unrelated
  object rows remain legacy-owned. Exact cross-plane catalog edges are now preserved by transport
  matching. The live resolver uses the shared tile-object cache, verifies landing against the
  catalog destination plane and coordinates, and models a closed trapdoor as `Open` followed by
  its actual climb action rather than treating object transformation as arrival. That slice and
  the direct NPC/ship plus gangplank slice have completed headless and live acceptance. Paid
  coin-only charter ships model the exact Trader Crewmember click, destination widget, `Yes`
  confirmation, and remote landing as one staged interaction; forward and reverse live acceptance
  both passed, closing the charter slice. Headless and broad walker tests pass.

## Why this work is needed

The current system has several overlapping owners:

- `Rs2Walker` owns the scripted destination, movement loop, recovery, interaction dispatch,
  cancellation, and much of route lifecycle.
- `ShortestPathPlugin` owns mutable pathfinder state, target markers, live-collision route
  validation, and another pathfinder lifecycle.
- `ShortestPathScript` owns a walk task plus an additional terminal-state retry loop.
- Static state and futures connect those owners indirectly through `Rs2PathApi`.

This makes a walk the product of multiple implicit state machines. Door, transport,
off-path, stall, live-collision, and retry branches can react to the same observation with
different actions. The result is hard-to-reproduce cancellation, duplicate clicks,
recalculation churn, and fixes that alter a distant recovery path.

## Goals

1. Give one component exclusive ownership of an active walk.
2. Make every tick/pass produce at most one movement or interaction command.
3. Represent route progress, pending interactions, recovery, and cancellation explicitly.
4. Reject stale asynchronous pathfinder results deterministically.
5. Preserve the existing public `Rs2Walker` entry points during migration.
6. Keep specialised transport behaviour without giving transports separate control loops.
7. Make orchestration headlessly testable; reserve live tests for client integration.
8. Delete the legacy branches as their replacements become proven.

## Non-goals

- Rewriting `Pathfinder`, `CollisionMap`, `PathSmoother`, or the transport datasets.
- Making every door, boat, teleport, shortcut, and ladder use identical internal logic.
- Changing plugin callers to understand pathfinder internals.
- Replacing all shortest-path UI, panels, or overlays during the executor migration.
- Solving missing or incorrect transport data as part of the architecture cutover.

### Ownership rules

- `NavigationEngine` is the only writer of active-walk state.
- `RoutePlanner` owns pathfinder task creation/cancellation. Neither the UI plugin nor an
  interaction handler manipulates its futures.
- `ShortestPathPlugin` may request, cancel, and observe a walk, but may not recalculate one
  directly.
- Interaction handlers propose or advance an interaction. They do not replan, clear the
  target, or issue an unrelated fallback click.
- Live-collision capture publishes an observation/event. The engine decides whether it
  invalidates the current route.
- UI and overlays consume immutable snapshots and never read mutable session internals.

## Core model

### NavigationRequest

An immutable request containing:

- request ID
- destination set and reached distance
- route options snapshot
- whether banked transports are allowed
- caller/source label for diagnostics
- cancellation token

### RoutePlan

An immutable result containing:

- request ID and route generation
- raw adjacent path
- smoothed click path
- explicit route edges
- transport steps and their raw-path anchors
- start, reachable endpoint, and requested destinations
- complete/partial status and calculation diagnostics

Raw and smoothed paths must be mapped once when the plan is created. Runtime code must not
reconstruct that relationship with repeated nearest-tile guesses.

### WalkSession

All mutable state for one request:

- current phase
- current route plan and generation
- raw/smoothed progress indices
- last observed player position
- last issued command and command timestamp
- pending interaction and its attempt state
- progress/stall evidence
- recovery attempts and budgets
- learned/temporarily blocked edges
- terminal result and reason

The session is instance state. It must not be shared through public static fields.

### Phases

```text
NEW
CALCULATING
FOLLOWING_ROUTE
APPROACHING_INTERACTION
PERFORMING_INTERACTION
VERIFYING_INTERACTION
REPLANNING

```

Transitions must be named and logged. A pass through the engine returns one decision and
does not recurse into another pass.

### Engine decisions

```text
NO_ACTION
CLICK_TILE
INTERACT
WAIT
REQUEST_REPLAN

```

Only `CLICK_TILE` and `INTERACT` may send input. Enforce at most one such decision per
engine pass.

### Interaction contract

Unify the protocol, not the domain logic:

```java
InteractionProposal inspect(RouteContext context);
InteractionProgress advance(InteractionProposal proposal, WalkerActions actions);
```

`InteractionProgress` should distinguish:

- `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- `APPROACH_REQUIRED`
- `COMMAND_ISSUED`
- `WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION`
- `CROSSED`
- `RETRYABLE_FAILURE`
- `UNAVAILABLE`

Handlers may keep specialised internal sequences. They may not clear the route, recalculate,
or fall through to a second handler after issuing a command.

## Concurrency and cancellation

Every request receives a monotonically increasing request ID. Every calculation within a
request receives a route generation.

When a calculation completes, publish it only when both values still match the active
session. A cancelled or superseded calculation may finish, but its result is discarded.

Use one pathfinding executor owner. Cancellation is:

1. mark the session cancelled;
2. invalidate its request ID/generation;
3. cancel the planner task;
4. publish a terminal snapshot;
5. remove UI marker state through the UI adapter.

Do not signal cancellation by temporarily setting a shared target to `null` and later
restoring it.

## Migration phases

Each phase must compile, pass its listed tests, and leave the branch shippable.

### Phase 0 - Baseline and invariants

No behaviour changes.

- Record the current route corpus and walker test results.
- Add architecture tests/grep checks for forbidden new dependencies:
  - no new direct `ShortestPathPlugin` mutable-state access outside `Rs2PathApi`;
  - no new recovery or interaction branches in `processWalk` without an explicit migration
    exception;
  - no interaction handler may call `setTarget`, `recalculatePath`, or planner lifecycle APIs.
- Define a compact decision trace format with request ID, generation, phase, observation,
  decision, and reason.
- Catalogue the existing public `Rs2Walker` methods and identify supported compatibility
  entry points versus unrelated helpers to move later.

Exit gate: baseline results and API inventory are committed and reproducible.

### Phase 1 - Extract planner ownership

No movement behaviour changes.

- Introduce `RoutePlanner` and a production adapter over the existing `Pathfinder`.
- Move executor/future/mutex ownership out of `ShortestPathPlugin` and
  `Rs2WalkerLifecycleRuntime` into that adapter.
- Add request ID and route generation checks.
- Return immutable `RoutePlan` objects instead of exposing the current mutable pathfinder as
  runtime state.
- Keep `Rs2PathApi` as a temporary compatibility bridge for unmigrated consumers.

Tests:

- stale calculation cannot replace a newer route;
- cancellation before and after calculation completion;
- simultaneous recalculate requests coalesce or deterministically supersede;
- partial and complete path results retain current semantics.

Deletion gate: remove duplicate pathfinder start/cancel implementations. There must be one
production owner of the pathfinding executor and future.

### Phase 2 - Introduce NavigationEngine in shadow mode

- Add `NavigationEngine`, `WalkSession`, phases, observations, and decisions.
- Feed it recorded/headless observations from existing walks.
- In shadow mode it emits decisions to diagnostics but sends no input.
- Compare its progress index, arrival, interaction-frontier, and replan decisions with the
  legacy walker.
- Publish `NavigationSnapshot` for diagnostics and future overlays.

Tests:

- phase transition table;
- one-command-per-pass invariant;
- cancellation is terminal;
- progress cannot move backward without a new route generation;
- benign movement-in-flight does not consume recovery budget.

Exit gate: corpus scenarios produce stable shadow decisions with every divergence classified.

### Phase 3 - Cut over ordinary walking

Scope only routes containing adjacent walk edges and no explicit transports or recognised
dynamic obstacles.

- Select clicks from a bounded forward window on the raw route; smoothing may inform progress and
  diagnostics but must not impose a line-of-sight click frontier.
- Move interim-target ownership, movement acknowledgement, arrival checks, and ordinary
  off-path replanning into the session.
- Keep existing minimap/canvas action utilities behind `WalkerActions`.
- Select legacy versus new execution once, when the request begins. Never let both executors
  act on one request.

Tests:

- straight, diagonal, cornered, doubled-back, partial, and unreachable routes;
- rejected minimap/canvas clicks;
- external movement and combat displacement;
- route cancellation during movement;
- route replacement while a click is in flight.

Deletion gate: remove the equivalent ordinary-click, interim, and basic off-path branches
from `processWalk`.

### Phase 4 - Centralise recovery

- Move stall evidence and recovery budgets into `WalkSession`.
- Recovery produces `WAIT`, `CLICK_TILE`, or `REQUEST_REPLAN`; it never directly recurses.
- Live-collision contradictions become route invalidation observations.
- Preserve bounded sidestep/rejoin logic from `RouteRecovery` where tests show value.
- Distinguish no acknowledgement, no tile progress, off-route movement, blocked edge, and
  interaction wait instead of treating all of them as generic stuck state.

Tests:

- each failure category has an independent budget and terminal reason;
- recovery cannot overwrite a recent valid command;
- repeated blocked edge is learned/replanned once per generation;
- recovery never issues more than one command per pass.

Deletion gate: satisfied for engine-owned ordinary routes—the engine returns before legacy
`stuckCount` and recovery-click control flow. Those paths remain isolated behind `LEGACY_LOCKED`
for dynamic obstacles/transports and are deleted family-by-family in Phases 5 and 6.

### Phase 5 - Migrate dynamic obstacles

Status: in progress. Mineable blockers have completed the code/test cutover for engine-owned
ordinary routes. The first live Motherlode route mined its blockers and arrived; one repeat route
confirmed the exact-anchor fix no longer interacts with adjacent rockfalls. Ranged interaction
and bounded edge-crossing then passed a forward/reverse live route with consecutive rockfalls.
The mineable slice is accepted for engine-owned routes; its old handler remains isolated to
`LEGACY_LOCKED` requests. The common ordinary door/gate code and headless tests are in progress;
the first live ordinary-door route dispatched the exact door successfully. That run exposed an
arrival-ordering defect when the target was inside the configured finish radius: completion could
overtake the still-pending door verification. Arrival is now deferred until the interaction edge
has been cleared and crossed. Repeat live acceptance crossed and retired the door correctly. A
multi-door route then exposed redundant one-tile crossing clicks between already-loaded
interactions; the common lifecycle now chains directly to the next exact, ready route interaction
and retains the one-edge minimap crossing only as a fallback. Reverse multi-door live acceptance
chained three successive doors, including a 17-tile server-pathing handoff, and arrived. Ordinary
doors/gates are accepted for engine-owned routes. The same interaction-chain contract is a required
acceptance condition for each Phase 6 transport and shortcut family. That acceptance log also
showed live-collision validation reporting the active door edge (with a one-index anchor skew) as a
generic block. Pending and cleared-but-uncrossed interaction edges now temporarily own their edge
and immediate neighbour for collision recovery; unrelated collision contradictions still replan.
The repeat corridor stayed on one route generation, chained all four doors, emitted no
`BLOCKED_EDGE` recovery, used the one-edge crossing only after the final door, and arrived. The
ordinary door/gate slice and its collision-ownership acceptance gate are complete.

The unusual-door inventory now has an explicit ownership boundary. `Pick-lock` doors and
`Pay-toll` gates are transport-catalog rows with requirements or dialogue, so they remain
transport-owned for Phase 6 instead of entering the ordinary-door scanner. Stronghold of Security
question doors expose ordinary-looking actions but require a multi-step dialogue; routes starting
or ending in its regions now remain legacy-owned, and the live ordinary-door scene rejects those
objects as a second guard. The legacy Stronghold handler remains the only owner until its sleeps and
dialogue loop are replaced by a non-blocking dialogue interaction state. This closes the unsafe
classification gap without disguising legacy dialogue execution as a migrated engine interaction.

Order: mineable blockers, then ordinary doors/gates, then unusual door/dialogue cases.

- Adapt the existing mineable resolver and door classifier/probe/geometry code to the
  interaction contract.
- Store the pending interaction in the session so it survives across passes.
- Separate approach, interaction, and crossing verification.
- On `UNAVAILABLE`, report the edge to the engine; the handler does not replan itself.
- Keep live scene reads behind a snapshot/adapter so classification remains headlessly
  testable.

Tests:

- obstacle ahead versus merely nearby;
- diagonal/cardinal door edges;
- opened without crossing;
- crossing while the exact landing predicate fails;
- dialogue/quest-locked door;
- blocker despawns while approaching;
- inverse adjacent interaction suppression.

Deletion gate: remove migrated door/rockfall scans and their attempt/cooldown fields from
`Rs2Walker`.

### Phase 6 - Migrate transports by family

Status: complete on implementation and headless verification (2026-09-15). NavigationEngine is the sole live executor;
unsupported routes fail without legacy fallback. The outer `handleTransports` loop is deleted.
All packaged direct-item rows and both seasonal item families now have staged adapters; the
final repeat full suite passes 2,278 tests with zero failures/errors and four skips, and both
Checkstyle tasks pass. Rebuilt-client acceptance of the latest
adapters is recorded separately as deferred, not inferred from older live traces. The current
dated ledger above supersedes the following historical rollout descriptions, including their
old `LEGACY_LOCKED` and simple-item classification statements.

Historical rollout: the adjacent same-plane slice completed its headless and live acceptance
gates.
The live adapter resolves the exact enabled directed row and its object id near the catalog origin,
then dispatches through `RouteInteraction.Kind.ADJACENT_TRANSPORT`. Persistent shortcut objects are
verified against the catalog row's directed destination boundary rather than only raw-edge progress;
transforming `Open`/`Pass` door-family objects may also prove clearance by disappearing. Missing
persistent shortcut objects are unavailable rather than assumed clear. Live forward/reverse
acceptance passed at the Al Kharid double gate without duplicate interaction, replan, or generation
churn. The stairs, ladders, trapdoors, and caves slice now has a conservative route kind, live
cache-backed resolver, staged closed-trapdoor handling, and catalog-destination landing
acknowledgement. Live acceptance passed on the three-floor Falador Castle staircase chain: the
engine dispatched all three directed catalog transitions without a minimap nudge between floors,
then continued through an ordinary door and arrived without replan or generation churn. Its
headless and live acceptance gates are complete.

The simple item/spell teleport slice now classifies direct originless casts and single-action items
as `SIMPLE_TELEPORT`, resolves the exact enabled row at the published raw edge, reuses the existing
item/spell command implementations, and acknowledges only at the catalog landing. Destination
submenus, wilderness confirmations, Master Scroll Book flows, and multi-option spell variants remain
legacy-owned. The exact Lumbridge Home Teleport now uses this lifecycle with a longer bounded cast
window and directed-landing retention. Planner, scanner, execution, and route-ownership
tests pass. Live item acceptance passed with a consumable tablet: exactly one unified interaction
was issued, the post-consumption transport refresh did not invalidate the pending command, landing
was acknowledged, and ordinary walking resumed on the same generation. A later ground-click
destination mismatch caused a normal replan; it occurred after teleport acknowledgement and is
tracked as input-adapter behavior rather than teleport-family failure. Direct-spell live acceptance
now also passes for Lumbridge Home Teleport: one engine-owned command survived the full cast,
acknowledged the directed landing, completed the final one-tile approach, and arrived without a
legacy handoff.

The dialogue/NPC/boat family has completed a conservative direct-action slice. Exact `SHIP`,
`BOAT`, and `NPC` rows are published as `NPC_TRANSPORT` only when they have a one-click non-`Talk-to`
NPC action, no currency/item requirement, and no separate destination display choice. Dispatch
re-resolves the enabled directed row plus exact NPC id/name, issues one NPC interaction, tolerates
the source NPC unloading during travel, and acknowledges only near the catalog landing. Planner,
scanner, execution, ownership, broad walker, and Checkstyle tests pass. Conversation choices,
paid confirmations, named special dialogue, and destination menus remain legacy-owned. The first
Port Sarim run issued the correct unified
Squire interaction, then exposed a legitimate intermediate ship scene far from the raw route before
the final landing. Pending voyage commands now suppress ordinary off-route recovery through that
scene and use a bounded 30-second boarding/landing window. A repeat proved that the intermediate
scene's shared destination plane also made nearest-route progress jump to the destination raw index
from 531 tiles away; `NPC_TRANSPORT` retirement now requires the catalog landing rather than raw
index advancement. Live Port Sarim-to-Void-Knights acceptance then passed after restart: the engine
issued one `NPC_TRANSPORT` command, retained the same request and generation through the voyage,
reached the catalog landing without off-route recovery or legacy handoff, and terminated as
arrived. Reverse acceptance remains outstanding before the direct-action NPC/boat slice is closed.
The first reverse attempt was correctly legacy-locked because the voyage lands on the Port Sarim
ship and the remaining `Cross;Gangplank` edge was outside the initial stairs/ladders/caves catalog
transition policy. Direct `Cross` on an exact catalogued `Gangplank` is now conservatively eligible
as `CATALOG_TRANSITION`, allowing the reverse Squire voyage and disembark edge to remain one
engine-owned interaction chain. Repeat live acceptance passed in both directions with plane-0
land destinations: each route issued exactly one `NPC_TRANSPORT` command followed by exactly one
gangplank `CATALOG_TRANSITION`, retained its request and generation through the voyage, and then
either arrived or resumed ordinary walking without legacy markers, replan, or duplicate input. The
direct-action NPC/ship slice has completed its headless and live acceptance gates; dialogue/menu
and paid variants remain legacy-owned for their later specialised slices. Scoping the dialogue
family then exposed that this accepted slice admits object-backed rows (Swamp Boaty, the
Tempoross Ferry, the Fremennik Boats, several quest Rowboats, Lunar Isle's `Go-inside;House`)
whose actor is a tile object the NPC-only scene could never resolve, so an engine-owned route
through one stalled to bounded terminal failure without wrong input. The live scene now falls
back to a tile object near the catalog origin — exact catalog id, or a transformed id with the
exact catalog name, always requiring the catalog action under hyphen/space-insensitive
formatting — the pending interaction retains the catalog id, and dispatch clicks the resolved
live action string. Forward and reverse Al Kharid Tempoross Ferry routes then passed with one
object-backed command each, stable request/generation, acknowledged landings, and no recovery or
legacy markers; the object-actor repair is accepted.

The paid charter-ship slice is now implemented behind a separate `CHARTER_SHIP` route kind. Only
enabled charter rows with an exact Trader Crewmember id/name/action, a named destination, and a
positive Coins fare are eligible; item requirements and other paid or dialogue protocols remain
legacy-owned. One pending interaction advances through the NPC click, exact destination widget,
and `Yes` confirmation, then remains active while the source UI unloads and the voyage runs. It
clears only near the directed catalog landing, so neither raw-route progress nor disappearance of
the refreshed usable row can retire it early. Route-publication, policy, scanner, three-stage
execution, broad walker, and Checkstyle tests pass. The first live attempt reached the Port Sarim
charter origin but published no charter interaction because the catalog NPC id `9342` was
transformed to live id `9377`. Charter NPC resolution now prefers the catalog id while safely
accepting a transformed id only with exact name/action and catalog-origin proximity; the focused
regression suite and Checkstyle pass. Repeat Port Sarim-to-Catherby acceptance then passed: the
engine issued the charter NPC and destination-stage inputs, retained request 1/generation 2
through the remote landing, chained the Catherby gangplank as one `CATALOG_TRANSITION`, resumed
ordinary walking, and arrived without legacy handoff or transport recovery. That charter interface
did not present a separate confirmation prompt, so the optional confirmation stage correctly
issued no command. The generation-1 destination mismatch occurred before the charter frontier and
matches the already isolated physical-mouse input race rather than charter execution. Reverse
Catherby-to-Port-Sarim acceptance then passed on request 2/generation 1: one NPC-stage and one
destination-stage command at the Catherby origin, landing acknowledged at the directed catalog
destination, one gangplank `CATALOG_TRANSITION`, and ordinary walking resumed to arrival with no
replan, recovery, duplicate input, or legacy markers. The paid coin-only charter-ship family has
completed its headless and live acceptance gates; item-fare, dialogue, and other paid protocols
remain legacy-owned for later specialised slices.

Do not rewrite all transports together. Suggested order:

1. adjacent same-plane shortcuts;
2. stairs, ladders, trapdoors, and caves;
3. simple item/spell teleports;
4. dialogue/NPC/boat transports;
5. charter, fairy ring, spirit tree, glider, quetzal, POH, seasonal, and other specialised
   families;
6. banked-transport route setup (headless and live complete).

For each family:

- preserve its existing interaction implementation initially;
- adapt its progress/result to the common interaction contract;
- pin headless decision tests and a small live route set;
- cut over that family;
- delete its old dispatch and bookkeeping before starting the next family.

Reuse the common interaction-chain lifecycle for every family: when the current edge clears and
the next exact interaction is loaded and ready, dispatch it directly and retain the cleared edge
until route progress confirms crossing. One-edge ground movement is only the fallback when no safe
successor exists. This applies to stairs, ladders, gates, agility shortcuts, and transport objects;
family handlers may classify and execute their interaction but may not add an independent
approach/crossing loop.

Required transport invariants:

- when the target actor or object is loaded and within the handler frontier, dispatch one
  ranged click and let the server path the approach — never stage extra movement clicks to
  stand adjacent first. Gate NPC dispatch on a single dispatch-time walkability check; never
  gate any family on line-of-sight (fails on solid geometry, deadlocks) or on per-candidate
  reachability sweeps inside scan loops (documented multi-second client-thread stalls);
- confirm crossing from location/plane/interface evidence appropriate to the family;
- suppress immediate inverse traversal;
- recalculate from the actual landing location when required;
- never let a transport handler issue a normal route click as an undocumented fallback.

Deletion gate: satisfied. `handleTransports` and its legacy-only bookkeeping are deleted; active
transport execution is owned by the engine family adapters. Broader unreachable facade/process
logic remains explicitly scoped to Phase 8.

### Phase 7 - Make ShortestPathPlugin an adapter

Status: **complete (2026-09-15)**. The UI publishes navigation intent, reads immutable engine
state, and satisfies the deletion gate below. Phase 8 remains deliberately untouched.

- Route map-click/hotkey requests through `NavigationEngine`.
- Render the path, target marker, ETA, and debug information from `NavigationSnapshot` and
  immutable `RoutePlan`.
- Replace `ShortestPathScript` terminal retry logic with an engine retry policy or remove it
  when the engine has explicit failure categories.
- Publish live-collision updates to the engine rather than invoking walker recalculation.
- Remove static mutable pathfinder, target, future, and executor state from the plugin.

Tests:

- UI target set/replace/clear;
- Ctrl+X cancellation;
- plugin shutdown with calculation or interaction in flight;
- login/world-hop refresh;
- overlays tolerate no active session and terminal sessions.

Deletion gate: `shortestpath` UI code no longer imports `Rs2Walker` implementation details;
the engine has no dependency on plugin UI classes.

### Phase 8 - Collapse the facade and remove legacy orchestration

Status: **complete (2026-09-16)**. Supported plugin APIs are preserved, NavigationEngine is the
only executor, the legacy loop/dual-mode state is deleted, and the headless plus rebuilt-client
acceptance gates below pass.

- Make supported static `Rs2Walker` methods thin delegates to the injected/service-owned
  engine boundary.
- Move banking, route-analysis, location-enum, puzzle, and unrelated convenience APIs out of
  the core executor class where practical.
- Delete dead obstacle abstractions, unused adapters, duplicate awaits, legacy state fields,
  and compatibility methods with no callers.
- Split `PathfinderConfig` only after executor migration, separating immutable route options,
  transport repository/availability, and collision provider.
- Update `docs/api/Rs2Walker.md`, entity movement gotchas, and architecture docs.

Exit gate:

- [x] no legacy `processWalk` orchestration remains;
- [x] one owner exists for request, session, calculation, and cancellation state;
- [x] old and new executor flags are gone;
- [x] the compatibility facade delegates lifecycle decisions and retains only public API plus
  live-scene/input adaptation;
- [x] full route corpus and rebuilt-client acceptance pass.

## Verification strategy

### Required on every phase

- `./gradlew :client:compileJava`
- focused headless tests for changed components
- existing walker/shortest-path unit tests
- no unexpected changes to route-corpus results
- review decision traces for duplicate input in the same pass

### Required before a behaviour cutover

- recorded/harness reproduction for the behaviour being moved;
- test that fails against the new component before the fix/migration;
- comparison of legacy and new terminal outcomes;
- cancellation test during the behaviour's longest wait.

### Required before deleting a legacy path

- production call sites point exclusively at the replacement;
- relevant route corpus and live scenarios pass;
- no fallback can silently invoke the deleted executor;
- state fields used only by the deleted path are removed in the same phase.

## Observability

Use one compact record per meaningful decision, behind the existing verbose toggle:

```text
[Nav] req=42 gen=3 phase=VERIFYING_INTERACTION
      at=3201,3218,0 edge=3201,3218,0->3202,3218,0
      decision=WAIT reason=door-command-awaiting-crossing ageMs=600
```

Always log terminal transitions at an appropriate normal level with a stable reason code.
Do not log player/session identifiers. Counters should include calculations, stale results,
replans by reason, commands by type, interaction attempts, recovery attempts, and terminal
outcomes.

## Safety and rollback

- Behaviour cutovers are family/scenario flags, not one flag per internal branch.
- A request selects its executor at creation; changing configuration cannot swap executors
  mid-session.
- Keep the legacy executor available only until the current phase's acceptance routes pass.
- Roll back by selecting legacy for new requests, never by handing an active session from one
  executor to the other.
- Remove each flag when its legacy path is deleted to prevent a permanent dual architecture.

## Pull request slicing

Prefer small vertical PRs with a deletion or enforceable boundary:

1. models and architecture tests;
2. planner ownership plus stale-result protection;
3. shadow engine;
4. ordinary walking cutover and deletion;
5. central recovery cutover and deletion;
6. one obstacle/transport family per PR;
7. plugin adapter cutover;
8. facade cleanup and final legacy deletion.

Avoid PRs that only move hundreds of lines from `Rs2Walker` into a new static helper while
leaving ownership and control flow unchanged.

## Completion criteria

The rewrite is complete when all of the following are true:

- one `NavigationEngine` owns each active `WalkSession`;
- one planner owner manages asynchronous pathfinding;
- stale route results cannot be published;
- one engine pass can issue at most one input command;
- interactions persist as explicit state across passes;
- UI, overlays, and callers observe immutable snapshots;
- `Rs2Walker` is a compatibility facade rather than an executor god-class;
- `ShortestPathPlugin` is a UI/live-data adapter rather than an automation state owner;
- old orchestration, duplicated lifecycle methods, retry loops, and migrated state fields are
  deleted;
- compile, unit, corpus, cancellation, and live acceptance checks pass.
